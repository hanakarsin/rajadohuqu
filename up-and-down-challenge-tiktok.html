With many people stuck at home during the coronavirus pandemic, people are spending much of their free time on the addictive video sharing app, and they're trying to increase their exposure through participating in challenges."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

In it, she and her and her partner perform an ab challenge to the Vengaboys song "Up & Down." One participant lies on the ground and uses their knees to hold the second person up in the opposite direction.&nbsp;</p><p>The quick repetition of the lyrics "up and down" indicate whether the person on the bottom does a sit-up, or lies back down.&nbsp;</p><p>After repeating the sit-up move several times, the top person then slides down and mimes a crawl. In @Sioned69's video, she ends the routine by doing a somersault to the ground.&nbsp;</p><p>The #UpAndDownChallenge has been viewed more than 331 million times, and celebrities have even gotten in on the fun too. Singer Olly Murs participated in the challenge with his girlfriend, and he posted the results on his Instagram page.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>Easters been a bit UP.....

While this would normally be good news for Vengaboys, especially since it was originally recorded in the '90s, the group wants TikTok users to stop making the videos.&nbsp;</p><p>Two members, Captain Kim and D-Nice, issued statements about being appreciative for the re-surge in attention for their decades-old song. But, they noted, the injuries that can result from participating in the challenge are not worth the risk.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span><p>Vengaboys in 2018.</p></figure><p>"We are of course delighted with the huge success, but we still want to ask the TikTok community to stop this challenge," Captain Kim said in a statement for the group. "If you break a finger or sprain your wrist, you still have to go to the hospital where they have more important things on their mind right now."&nbsp;</p><p>"At least TikTok has added a warning to the 'Up and Down' challenge videos," D-Nice continued. "And even though we can see that a lot of people are having fun, we are pleading with them to stop."</p><p>Whether users heed the warnings of the Vengaboys members remains to be seen.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqr1urc2dZJ2np6N6pLTApaOeppeaerW1yq2mpA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. ¬© 2022.
