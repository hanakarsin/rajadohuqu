Growing up, Aleister's family was quite poor. According to the star, unlike other children, he and his siblings could not afford the toys they wanted.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/07c332e0acf336c7.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Chris Motionless (Cerulli) biography: Age, height, wife, daughter</span></p></a><p class=align-left>However, despite their circumstances, they never felt trapped by their situation.

Black refers to his father as both his best friend and his worst enemy. He goes further to compare him to the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">cyborg on <i>The Terminator</i></a><i>.</i></p><p class=align-left>His childhood was further complicated by his father's involvement with the occult and cult-like religions. At eight-years-old, Tom started researching these cultic religions and government conspiracies. The result of this was that he grew up incredibly fearful of the dark. Luckily, at about 13 or 14-years-old, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">he outgrew this fear</a>.</p><p class=align-left>Black has also admitted to never being truly happy, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">dealing with mental illness</a>, feelings of inadequacy, severe anxiety and depression.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/b2c569013902917c.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Angus Cloud’s biography: Age, acting career, life before Euphoria, death</span></p></a><h2>Career</h2><p class=align-left>While still in school, Tom expressed his interest in becoming a pro wrestler.

This is because none of the superstars' fans knew that the two had been dating.</p><p class=align-left>While <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">rumours about their romance</a> had been swirling around, Zelina Vega and Aleister Black never denied or confirmed them. Their nuptials were officiated by their close friend, real estate developer and Great Lakes Championship Wrestling owner David Herro.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/d435e1a4d945333e.jpg><p class=align-left>While the two seem happily married, most details about the Aleister Black Zelina Vega relationship remains a mystery.

Most of his personas on the ring are very dark and seem to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">draw inspiration from</a> the occult culture.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/c93e08673be812fb.jpg><p class=align-left>He also has multiple demonic tattoos all over his body.

While some may argue that these two do not necessarily worship the devil, the wrestler has a more disturbing tattoo.</p><p class=align-left>Black has the words <i>Ave Satanas </i>inked on the sides of his palms. The Latin word means 'hail satan' in English. In 2018, fellow pro wrestler, Josh Barnett, said that Tom's ring name 'Aleister' comes from the infamous <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Aleister Crowley</a>.</p><p class=align-left>It should be noted that Crowley was a known and practicing satanist.

However, in pop culture, it is a blasphemous term that mocks the Catholic church's mass. The black mass is usually <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">practiced by satanic cults</a>.</p><p class=align-left>When it comes to Aleister, the star uses this term to brand <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">some of his merchandise</a>. He also has a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">wrestling move</a> by the same name.</p><h2>Aleister Black injury</h2><p class=align-left>To all wrestling fans, the sport is exciting to watch. It is thrilling to see your favourite stars fight it out on the ring to determine the winner. To critics, however, wrestling is a fake and scripted game.</p><p class=align-left>Whether you believe that the sport is fake or real, there is no denying that performers experience some very painful and sometimes life-threatening injuries while competing.</p><p class=align-left>Late last year, Black suffered what appeared to be a broken nose during his fight with fellow wrestler, Buddy Murphy. Nevertheless, it did not appear to be a serious issue as he was cleared to appear in several other matches.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/2d78e7587f29c59b.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Exciting details about Billy Porter.
