Hannah earned a silver medal in BMX freestyle during the Tokyo Olympics in 2021, an obviously impressive feat, but one that felt like a disappointment after she had entered the tournament as the odds-on favorite."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Her left foot slipped off the pedal, and she broke her foot just seconds into the run, limping off early.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-fyFmx rJYJh"><span>Source: YouTube</span></figure><p>“I made just a dumb mistake that I wasn’t able to let go of for a really, really long time,” she said. “A lot of people on the internet told me that I gave up, which was whatever. As soon as my foot slipped my pedal, there was nothing I could do. I had to be perfect. I knew that it had to be perfect, and it wasn’t. So that was a super hard pill to swallow.”</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Hannah wanted to redeem herself in Paris.</h2><p>“It would be really cool to say that I’m an Olympic gold medalist,” she said prior to her arrival in Paris. “That’s super awesome, and it’s another thing to add to the resume, but I have a pretty solid understanding that my resume as it is right now is very, very strong."</p><p>"As cool as it would be to bring it back for Team USA, it wouldn’t affect me much as a person," she added. "It wouldn’t change anything about my life. It would just be extremely special to win it with my whole family there.”</p><p>Unfortunately, she came up short, but she remains one of the most decorated BMX riders of all time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyhmKmolaOypXnTqGShmZ6jrql50aiZnqqkqA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
