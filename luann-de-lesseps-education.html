From Leah McSweeney going back and forth with Ramona Singer to Aviva Drescher facing off against everyone, the show knows how to serve up the drama. And at one point, <a href=#>Eboni K. Williams</a> followed suit unapologetically.</p><p>The drama played out as the ladies launched into sexual talk over lunch at <a href=#>Luann de Lesseps</a>'s home, and things went left once education and class got thrown into the mix. Once Eboni stated the obvious about her notable education, Luann quickly took offense. So, it made viewers wonder about Luann’s education. Read on as we give you the lowdown.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Luann attended E.C. Goodwin Technical High School and earned her qualification to be a licensed practical nurse.</h2><p>It seems that anything is up for debate on RHONY. And after Eboni made the comment that she is the “most educated person at the table,” Luann lost it.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><p>In case you didn’t know, Luann has also received an impressive education. While her education may not be the same as Eboni's — Eboni is a lawyer — Luann has spent time focusing on her studies.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Patch</a> reports that Luann is a licensed practical nurse. The star earned her license after studying at the E.C. Goodwin Technical High School in New Britain, Conn.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Luann de Lesseps (@countessluann)</a></p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Insatgram</a></figure><p>“I really felt like I had a good education in Connecticut,” she told the outlet. “I loved math and home economics in high school. Kids can't even sew buttons on their coats nowadays."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Why did Eboni and Luann feud? Eboni believed that Luann essentially called her an angry Black woman.</h2><p>If you’re familiar with RHONY, then you likely know that Luann doesn’t always do a good job of owning up to her mistakes. And her argument with Eboni on Season 13 Episode 5 rubbed viewers the wrong way.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Luann if you don’t have a degree, just say that! Lol you know good and well Eboni is the most educated at that table. Education and culture are obviously not the same thing <a href=#>#RHONY</a></p>— ✨ (@miss_nwagbara) <a href=#>June 4, 2021</a> <span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>The argument kicked off as Ramona shared her opinions about being classy and not using sexual terms during conversation. Luann supported Ramona’s claims by saying that using raunchy language wasn't classy.</p><p>Eboni quickly chimed in to correct the ladies.</p><p>“I don’t subscribe to the fact that to use those words means that you're unclassy or you’re not a lady,” Eboni told the ladies on the series.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>“It has nothing to do with class, it has to do with education,” Luann told Eboni.</p><p>Eboni then explained that she has more formal education than any of the women at the table, and Luann immediately got offended.</p><p>“Do you think that your degree makes you more educated?” Luann asked Eboni.</p><p>The conversation got more heated after Luann accused Eboni of calling her an uneducated person. As Eboni explained herself, Luann got more triggered as the two went back and forth. She eventually called Eboni an angry woman and kicked her out of her home.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>So Heather can state a fact about Lu on her podcast, even tho it’s damaging, & Lu brushes it off but <a href=#>@EboniKWilliams</a> states a fact about her education & she gets called angry, loud & gets kicked out of Luann’s house?
