And people appear not to care about what is happening. If I tell you what I know is happening in Nigeria today, you will no longer sleep.</p><p>“So, Chief Ayo Adebanjo’s warning and advice are very timely. If you want details, I will give it to you privately.</p><p>“We are in a big hole as a nation. And people who put us in this hole have continued today. So, we’ve to wake up. Only we can save ourselves.</p><p>“The fifth columnists’ activities going on among your people are not helping matters. May Almighty God continue to bless this country, but only we can save ourselves from ourselves.”</p><p>Earlier, <strong>Chief Ayo Adebanjo</strong>, a foremost Afenifere leader, had lamented that Yorubaland was in danger and most governors in the Southwest are taking responsibility for their citizens.</p><p>“Buhari is not ruling the country. He wants to dominate us. I don’t mince words about it. There’s tyranny in the country. There’s anarchy. When the Head of State said there’s no respect for the rule of law, where are the lawyers? The moment there’s no respect for the rule of law, there’s no government again, there’s anarchy.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWlpZH5ze5FpZqehl5q%2Fqq3NrGSwoZyheq%2B702aqpZ2VpXqis8CipWahlmK2br7Er5yapF2staLAjKKqZp%2Bfnruoec6nZKKmXam1pnnCqKynrKKuerXFjJ2Yp6Kloq5ur9GinKxln6rBcA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
