At that time, many did not know the reason why these two split. But now, we can confirm that money was the root of their problem.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Olajumoke Orisaguna reaches out to old woman whose home is about to be demolished</p><p class=align-left>Apparently, Funke Akindele removed Toyo baby from the series because she demanded for more pay a source revealed to Tns.ng. Akindele via her production manager and younger sister Abimbola pays actors between N3,000 and N150,000 (per episode/season of the show) depending on their role.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/1120/vllkyt2u1r8k87v5rg.jpeg><p class=align-left>Toyo baby’s request did not go down well with Funke because she felt Toyo was being an ingrate since she rose to fame via her appearance on the popular show. Also, actors Lota Chukwu, Omotunde Lolo 1, Falz D Bahd Guy (who has since exited the show) and Olayode are the highest paid actors who take home N150,000 per season. The rest take home much less.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/vllkyt56snpkvvojt.jpeg><p class=align-left>More popular stars like Tiwa Savage, Toke Makinwa and others who have had brief cameo appearances on the show reportedly got between N100,000 and N300,000 for ‘showing face’.
