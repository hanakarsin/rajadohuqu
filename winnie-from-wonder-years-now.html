In fact, <a href=#>the series has even gotten its own reboot</a>! In September 2021, the new version, starring Elisha Williams and Dulé Hill, premiered on ABC.</p><p>These days, while Danica still identifies as an actress, she’s also an incredibly intelligent mathematician. She’s <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">penned 10 math books</a> geared towards children, and even has a theorem named after her! Working with numbers isn’t for everyone, but for Danica, it’s what makes the most sense.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Danica McKellar (@danicamckellar)</a></p><span>Source: Instagram @DanicaMcKellar</span></figure><p>Math is obviously one of her greatest passions since according to Forbes, the UCLA graduate even wrote a song dedicated to the number pi.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What about Danica's other TV projects?</h2><p>A life focused on mathematics is probably super fulfilling for someone like Danica who has a passion for numbers, but that doesn’t mean she’s completely strayed from television work. The Wonder Years alum appeared on Season 18 of <a href=#>Dancing With the Stars</a>, where she was partnered with <a href=#>Valentin Chmerkovskiy</a>. She did pretty well with her dance moves and the pair landed in sixth place!</p><p>Another place to spot Danica is on the <a href=#>Hallmark Channel</a>. She’s been part of a dozen Hallmark TV productions over the years. Most recently, it’s been revealed that she’ll be parting ways with the network. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TV Insider</a>, Danica has signed an exclusive deal with GAC, one of the Hallmark Channel’s biggest competitors.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Danica McKellar (@danicamckellar)</a></p><span>Source: Instagram @DanicaMcKellar</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Is Danica married with kids now?</h2><p>Between 2009 and 2013, Danica was married to Mike Verta, and they share a son named Draco. After their marriage fell apart, Danica remarried Scott Sveslosky in 2014 and they’ve been together ever since. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Wide Open Country</a>, Danica met Scott through mutual friends and thought he was a “nice guy" from the start.</p><p>After going on a coffee date filled with a lot of laughter, they knew it was a match made in heaven.
