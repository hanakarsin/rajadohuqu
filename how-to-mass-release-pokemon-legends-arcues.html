Releasing Pok√©mon is one of the only ways to get Grit in the game.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Nintendo</span></figure><p>The new <a href=#>Pok√©mon Legends: Arceus</a> employs new and creative ways for trainers to interact with and gather data on <a href=#>Pok√©mon</a>, unlike any of the games before it. Because of this, there are also quite a few new features in the game that players are unfamiliar with ‚Äî like the pastures their Pok√©mon are now stored in.</p><p>How do you mass release the Pok√©mon in your pastures? Here's why you won't want to horde every one you capture in Legends: Arceus.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">How to mass release the Pok√©mon in your pastures in 'Legends: Arceus.'</h2><p>Unlike other Pok√©mon games, Legends: Arceus is focused more on capturing Pok√©mon than battling with other trainers. As you venture around the lands, you'll find yourself tasked with capturing multiple of the same Pok√©mon. As you report your findings to the professor, you'll turn over the Pok√©mon you captured (who are not part of your party). They'll then be transported to the pastures in Jubilife Village.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Nintendo</span></figure><p>These pastures act as the PC boxes in previous games, holding any Pok√©mon not currently a part of your party. Unlike in other games, though, you'll likely find your pastures filled with multiples of the same Pok√©mon, as some Pok√©Dex entries require you to catch upward of 25 of the same type to complete the entry.</p><p>Because of this, you'll find yourself needing to release excess Pok√©mon back into the wild. You can, of course, do this one by one when swapping Pok√©mon out of your party.</p><p>Once you've filled up four of the "boxes" to your pasture, you'll unlock the option to release multiple Pok√©mon at once. To do this, visit the pastures back at Jubilife Village and talk to the main NPC standing outside of them.</p><p>In the pastures menu, click "X" and it will allow you to choose multiple Pok√©mon from the boxes. You'll then be able to release all of the Pok√©mon you select at once.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Been playing more Legends Arceus and I‚Äôve really enjoyed it.<br>Got a pretty cute moment in the pastures!</p><p>She sleep ü•∫ <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/kHVcv12tLR</a></p>‚Äî Zane‚Äôs Audios (@Zanes_Audios) <a href=#>January 30, 2022</a> <span>Source: Twitter / @Zanes_Audios</span></figure><p>You don't have to release the Pok√©mon right away, but it's important to note that once your pastures are filled, you won't be able to capture more Pok√©mon and, therefore, won't be able to make more progress on the game.</p><p>Besides, you don't really need 25 Bidoofs on your team ‚Äî so it's best to make room for the Pok√©mon that you really do need. Also, the more Pok√©mon you release the more Grit you'll be rewarded.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What is Grit? This item is essential ‚Äî and can be obtained by releasing Pok√©mon from your pastures.</h2><p>Grit is a new item to Pok√©mon trainers. It comes in different sizes and is an important item that's used to increase your Pok√©mon's stats.</p><p>Players get Grit Dust, Grit Gravel, Grit Pebbles, and Grit Rocks. These different sizes of Grit increase a Pok√©mon's Effort Level by varying points. Effort Levels increase your Pok√©mon's stats further than what they already get from leveling up. The higher the level of Pok√©mon, the more effective the Grit is ‚Äî and the bigger the Grit, the more it raises your Pok√©mon's Effort Level.</p><p>Releasing multiple Pok√©mon at once is the fastest way to earn Grit on your journey, though there are a few other methods you can employ, just as defeating Alpha Pok√©mon, or trading it for better Grit.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnby4edOoZKaZo6h6s7HLnpisnV2lvKyxzKilZqSVnLKvsNJmmKubpZrA</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. ¬© 2022.
