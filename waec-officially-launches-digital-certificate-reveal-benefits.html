According to him, one of the benefits of the new technology includes giving certificate holders the power to prevent unauthorized users from accessing their data.</p><p>“The platform is compliant with global best practices by ensuring that the data of candidates are protected securely and cannot be accessed by the parties without the consent of certificate owners.</p><p>“Institutions and organisations can confirm with ease the reliability and authenticity of individuals’ certificates on the digital certificates platform. This eliminates fraud and will send unscrupulous persons out of the market. It has many security doors that make it possible to hack,”&nbsp;Areghan said.</p><p>He explained further that universities, institutions and organisations can as well enjoy a seamless, secure, and fast confirmation process with the digital platform.</p><p>“It also allows for bulk confirmation of certificates at once. This saves valuable admission costs and time”, Areghan added.</p><p>The HNO assured that the platform is well secured and safe from hackers, pointing out that since the commencement of the assessment, certificates have been issued to represent students’ performance in examinations.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH5xe5FqZrCZlZh6sLLFopqimZyhxm64wK6lnKCVqHqltcaiq5qkXZiys8DIn6CcmaSaerOx1Z6YpWWSmrumssitqmg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
