During an interview with Jeff Lewis Live, the former Trading Spaces host claimed Shep was “belligerent” and “wasted” while sitting next to her at a gambling table. Her description of the “horrific” event made its rounds on social media and included accusations that Shep may engage in alcohol abuse.</p><p>In his own words, Shep stated he hadn’t quit alcohol altogether, saying at the reunion, “I just don’t drink liquor. I don’t drink shots. I just drink beer.” The change was something Shep deemed after realizing he wasn’t prioritizing his physical or mental health.</p><p>“I didn’t have anything,” he recalled thinking at BravoCon. “I thought, ‘Who am I? How am I of any value to anybody? You’re hurting yourself, bro. My body and my mind are telling me, ‘No, no, no, sir.’ I can’t do it anymore the way that I used to.”</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Bravo</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">Shep said his drinking played a role in his breakup with Taylor Ann Green.</h2><p>Shep admitted his relationship with alcohol affected multiple facets of his life, including his and <a href=#>Taylor Ann Green</a>’s romance.

I would be a different person. I would be like, ‘I met someone I really care about, and this is it.’”</p><p>Taylor, who also attended the reunion, listened as her ex poured his soul onstage. She said hearing Shep discuss turning his life around “makes me happy,” and she hopes he can be more authentic moving forward.</p><p>“I know the real Shep,” Taylor explained. “He’s an incredible, kind, smart human being.”</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">Is Shep Rose leaving ‘Southern Charm?’</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Bravo</span></figure><p>While Shep had a rough few years on Southern Charm, he isn’t ready to leave Charleston, S.C. yet.
