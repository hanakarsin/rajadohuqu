I think their anger followed a leakage that the amount collected has reduced from about N10 billion to N1billion.</p><p>“Governor Wike’s disclosure of a N1 billion gift to the party before the PDP Presidential primaries has compounded the challenge in the party because some NWC members and stakeholders were just hearing for the first time.</p><p>“The anger is mounting and Wike’s camp is already capitalizing on the situation to push for accountability and plot Ayu’s exit.</p><p>“I can tell you that the party is in a tinderbox. Some forces wanted to use accountability as an excuse to cause confusion. We know that Ayu has repeatedly assured party leaders of being accountable and transparent.”</p><p>The source added: ”These NWC members have been adamant on accountability. They are demanding the whereabouts of the huge cash.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH16e5FvZp%2Bqlai1bsDRqKybpJVis7C%2BjJqwrmWRqHqxsM9mpbCbXabCpr%2FToqanZZSewKK8z56Yq5memLJuu8VmpWpoXZe2rbjIqKVmpp%2Bitq%2Bt06Kmp2WWmrK0ew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
