However, a huge downside could be that home is your comfort zone for relaxing. It’s hard to get that motivation going when the couch is right there.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>The mega-popular social media app, TikTok, has been a huge resource for people looking for at-home workouts to try while gyms are still closed. While searching for workouts, one name that keeps popping up everywhere is a fitness guru by the name of <a href=#>Chloe Ting</a>. Chloe is best known for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>her YouTube channel</u></a> that hosts videos for her most popular fitness plan, <a href=#>the 2-week shred challenge</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Chloe was originally a statistician before YouTube fame.</h2><p>Before her YouTube challenge blew up, Chloe graduated with a master’s degree in financial marketing. She told whimn.com.au., “I used to hate the fact that I did so much study ‘cause I felt it was useless. I'm into this creative space, I love creating things … But now it actually prepped me to be able to explain things better, even for a YouTube video.”</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: instagram</span></figure><p>Though now she is YouTube royalty, her beginning was less than graceful. “I feel like the first 20 videos that I made were just so horrible. I think the worst one was probably more like fashion, though,” she said, “I wasn't really a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTuber</a>, I was blogging, and I was like, ‘You know what? Let me just upload a piano cover, just because I love this song.’ I wasn't thinking of becoming a YouTuber or anything like that at that time.”</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Chloe is close to breaking 8 million followers on YouTube.</h2><p>Chloe, now a fitness and travel vlogger, is touting a respectable 7.98 million followers on YouTube with 623,588,900 total views.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>Her most popular video, and the one that inspired the #chloetingchallenge hashtag on TikTok,&nbsp;is her “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Get Abs in Two Weeks</u></a>” video which has 110 million views, followed by her “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Do This Everyday to Lose Weight</u></a>” video, which has been seen by 46 million people.</p><p>In her shred challenge, Chloe practices multiple different ab exercises involving reverse crunches, a Spider-man plank, Russian twists, a plank with hip dips, and an up and down plank, all of which 'burn' the abdominal region and help you achieve a tighter core.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">TikTok users are freaking out over their results.</h2><p>The hashtag #chloetingchallenge has gone viral on TikTok as tons of users are sharing their journey through her two-week program to see if what Chloe recommends for a daily workout actually gives you abs.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@gianinanabanana href=#>@gianinanabanana</a><p>chloe you’re my herooo <a title=chloetingchallenge href=#>##chloetingchallenge</a> <a title=justdancemoves href=#>##JustDanceMoves</a> <a title=fyp href=#>##fyp</a> <a title=foryoupage href=#>##foryoupage</a> @chloe_t</p><a title="♬ Mrs Savage - sunrae_music" href=#>♬ Mrs Savage - sunrae_music</a></figure><p>One TikTok user wrote, “chloe you’re my herooo.” While another user who tried out the challenge wrote about how it has actually helped her lose weight.
