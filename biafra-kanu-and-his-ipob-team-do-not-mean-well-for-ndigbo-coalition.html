Uche Ude, Mazi Osigwe for the Igbo Unity Congress, Deaconess Grace Ejike for the Southeast Market Women Vanguard and the Southeast Youth Network, represented by Pastor Andy Okoro also commended the Governors fro their stand.</p><p>In their submission, they noted that Kanu wasn’t elected as a representative of the region and his actions might endanger the peace and unity of the Ndigbo.</p><p>They, therefore, warned him to desist from his action and urged the people of the region to support their constitutional leaders.</p><p>“We wish to strongly condemn Nnamdi Kanu’s threat to Southeast governors and local vigilantes following the governors’ opposition of his illegal activities in the region among which is his formation of a militia group to disturb the peace of our region.</p><p>“We call on our governors who are elected by the people to represent them not to be intimidated by Kanu’s threat. They should go all out against him by exposing him for what he is, for the betterment, peace and unity of Igbo land.</p><p>“It is not in the place of Kanu and IPOB to institute laws for the people of the South East but the functions of governors of the region who were elected constitutionally by their people to act in that regard.</p><p>“Kanu and his team do not mean well for Ndigbo. From all indications, it can be glaringly seen that his actions are for his personal benefits and not for the generality of Ndigbo as he tries desperately to portray,” their statement reads.</p><p>Meanwhile, the spokesman of the pan-Yoruba group, Afenifere, <strong>Yinka Odumakin</strong>, on Wednesday disclosed that the National Leader of the All Progressives Congress, Bola Tinubu, is not the main leader of the Yoruba people.</p><p>Odumakin <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>stated this</a></strong> on Wednesday during an interview with Punch.</p><p>The Afenifere spokesperson further stated that the former Governor of Lagos State, Ekiti State Governor, Kayode Fayemi, or any non-Yoruba aspirant has not been endorsed for the 2023 presidency.</p><p>He added that the General Overseer of the Citadel Global Community Church in Lagos, Pastor Tunde Bakare, has not been endorsed by the group.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpgZH5ze5JqZpuhkZu%2FonnKmqWuZZGjsW60yKxkoqifl3q1scCmZJ2nXaO8tXnMnpinZaeaua15xaipZqaUnrSju4ycppqkmam2sLqO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
