They work hard but are paid lower wages. It happens because women are thought to be weaker employees if compared to men.</li><li><strong>Illiteracy.</strong> Due to a lack of education, about 774 million people around the world cannot read. 61 percent of them are girls. A child of a mother who is illiterate has fewer chances to survive the age of five. Illiteracy is the primary reason why they cannot gain the necessary knowledge and help their children to cope with diseases in the right way.</li><li><strong>Infant life expectancy.</strong> Due to some cultural matters, many tribes give preference to male children. The girls are provided with fewer survival advantages. That’s why one can observe a high risk of child mortality of girls between the ages from one to five years.</li><li><strong>Access to medical care.</strong> Most of the mothers in developing countries, which have problems with gender inequality, give birth to their babies in improper conditions. The men get both necessary medical care and vaccination.</li><li><strong>Human trafficking.</strong> About 71 percent of the total human trafficking rate is accounted for women and girls. In most cases, they trafficked with the purpose sexual exploitation.</li><li><strong>Women leadership positions in government.</strong> Gender inequality is one of the key reasons why you do not see a lot of women in administrative organs.</li><li><strong>Child marriages.</strong> This problem destroys not only the hope for a happy future but isolates the young girls from the world and the opportunities, which are accessible for men.</li><li><strong>Violence against women and sexual assault.</strong> Women often become the victims of violence and sexual assault both at work and home.</li><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/vllkyt7s4nv395kae.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What effect does corruption have on Nigeria?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The only way out of the gender inequality problem is expanding women's rights, freedoms, desire to get education and work.
