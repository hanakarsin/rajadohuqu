Source: Sonja Flemming/CBSIf you're watching Season 26 of Big Brother, you've probably noticed that Angela Murray is always in the middle of the drama. The 50-year-old real estate agent has had her fair share of clashes with fellow houseguests like Matt Hardeman, Kenney Kelley, and Los Angeles-based celebrity chef Lisa Weintraub."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

But after Lisa won the Power of Veto and saved herself, Angela set her sights on Matt.</p><p>On Tuesday, July 23, just a day after the POV ceremony, Angela and Lisa had at least two conversations (though the live feeds were often cut, so there may have been more). Their first chat was pretty civil, but the second one â€” blocked from the live feeds â€” reportedly sparked some serious drama.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr><a href=#>#BB26</a> Angela called Lisa Tinkerbell in their fight. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/Qi6bB4TbOI</a></p>â€” BB Live Updaters #bb26 (@BBLiveUpdaters) <a href=#>July 24, 2024</a></figure><p>In a post-argument clip, Angela revealed she ended the fight by calling Lisa "Tinkerbell" and telling her to "go sprinkle your fairy dust." Angela then told <a href=#>Makensy Manbeck</a> that her only regret was not having a better comeback. Wow, she is a savage!</p><p>Then, on Tuesday, July 30, live feed viewers watched as Angela took her feud with Lisa to a new level of entertainment. As she strutted through the Big Brother house, Angela spotted Lisa and decided to put on a show.</p><p>She dramatically swung her arms and shoulders, flashed a big smile, and stomped her feet on the floor â€” seemingly imitating Lisa's walk. Lisa was too stunned to speak, barely able to process the spectacle unfolding in front of her.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Angela mocks Lisa's walk as she walks by her <a href=#>#BB26</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/cdkWYebZ7p</a></p>â€” winter (@simplewntr) <a href=#>July 30, 2024</a></figure><p>The chaotic situation has gone viral on social media, especially on X (formerly Twitter), sparking plenty of reactions from Big Brother fans.</p><p>"I f--king love her y'all, I'm sorry," one person <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">posted</a> on X.

BB better do everything under the sun and the MOON to keep Angela," a fourth Big Brother fan <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">chimed in</a>. "I'm riding with Angela this season, no one else. I DON'T CARE!"</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>This is why we need more players over 50.
