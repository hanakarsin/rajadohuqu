This is made worse by the red carpet reception given to him, which he doesn’t deserve.</p><p>“But since it has happened, there is no need to cry over spilled milk. What is very clear is that our leaders, especially President Buhari have forgiven Fani-Kayode and embrace him as one of us.”</p><p>Lukman added however that since the party leadership seems to have forgiven Fani-Kayode, other party members should do the same and move on.</p><p>“Members of the APC should show understanding,” he said.</p><p>Lukman went on to say since the APC attained power in 2015, many opportunistic politicians have also joined the party but the leaders have welcomed them with open arms.</p><p>He lamented that many original members of the party are outraged by this, particularly since they seem neglected for the defectors who may end up betraying the party.</p><p>He further warned the party leaders against the mistake of investing trust and confidence in the wrong people and called on the members to regardless of how they feel, continue to support the APC even as the 2023 elections draw near.</p><p>“Contrastingly, those who are consistent and loyal to our party and our leaders hardly gained the deserved respect they should have.</p><p>“This may not necessarily be intended, but it is there. Be that as it may, members need to move forward with every confidence and commitment to engage our leaders,” he said.</p><p>He added that&nbsp;“To that extent, therefore, party members should respect the decision of our leaders to admit Fani-Kayode and welcome him with a red carpet reception.</p><p>“On no account should we be distracted. If Fani-Kayode needs a red carpet reception to be a member of APC, millions of party members have demonstrated that they don’t need any form of recognition to work for Nigeria.</p><p>“Being very consistent and stable members of the APC, we should also recognize that the party is partly what it is today on account of our little contributions over the years,” he said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH16e5ByZp%2BZnp56rK3YqJueZZiWwG6%2Fx6iprWWTlr2ir8itsGasn2KvtrXLnWSappRiwLa%2F05qgp2WimrmiwMiopaygmaXAbq3PnGSgp6aav6%2B70axkn6eiqrpusMZo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
