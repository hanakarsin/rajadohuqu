Reluctantly, she agrees and ends up on a gym date with <a href=#>Jake Cunningham</a> from Season 1 of <a href=#>The Ultimatum: Marry or Move On</a>.</p><p>Initially hitting it off, Tolú and Jake return to the villa only to find their spark fading. Jake's attention wanders to the other ladies, which doesn't work out well since he fails to secure a match and leaves the villa sooner than expected. But will we see him again? Nope.</p><p>While many of this season's past cast members return to the villa for a second chance at finding love, Jake is notably absent. So, what happened to him? Here's what we know.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">What happened to Jake from Season 2 of 'Perfect Match'?</h2><p>At the time of writing, Jake Cunningham's disappearance from Season 2 of Perfect Match is a total mystery. His absence goes unacknowledged by the rest of the cast, leaving fans to speculate about the reason for his sudden absence.</p><p>Now, with Jake's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">lack of social media activity</a>, it's doubtful he'll shed light on his absence anytime soon. Unless <a href=#>Netflix</a> decides to address the situation and offer an explanation, which seems unlikely, the mystery surrounding Jake's absence remains unresolved.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><p>Alright, let's put on our detective hats! If we had to venture a guess, Jake may have walked out of the show due to personal reasons. Perhaps he wasn't quite ready to dive into the whole "finding his perfect match" thing after all. So, he probably decided to hit pause, kick back, and focus on being single for a while longer.</p><p>But who's to say? Maybe the Army veteran just didn't feel the sparks flying with any of the ladies in Season 2. So, Jake did everyone a favor by following his gut and hitting the road before things got too complicated. If this just so happens to be the case, then Jake spared himself and the women from cringe-worthy dates and potential heartache.</p><p>Perfect Match is now streaming on Netflix.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyhmKmolaOypXnTqGSjmZuaeqe%2BzqZkrJ2RqLyveZFmpp9loJq%2Fp7HCrWSmmaSYtQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
