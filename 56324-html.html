I’m thinking he’s going to come in with a couple of other people.</i></p><p><i>“Then one woman comes up and asks me where the bathroom is and I look up and it’s freaking Beyoncé.”</i></p><p>Pilicer reassured the Single Ladies hitmaker she wouldn’t be disturbed by other revellers with just TWO of the 17 karaoke rooms being occupied when the group arrived to the South Beach venue.</p><p>But Queen B wasn’t bothered and instead of hiding out to chill with her friends she insisted on joining another party.</p><p>When she stumbled across a hired booth, she “walked right in” to hear them singing Party, a hit from her previous album ‘4’.</p><p><i>“There’s no way we could have planned it, no one had any idea,”</i> said Pilicer.</p><p><i>“They didn’t immediately recognise who either of them were. They started dancing together but still had no idea who it is.
