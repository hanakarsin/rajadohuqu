However, Disney is much more than what we may traditionally associate the brand with. With the launch of <a href=#>Disney+</a>, fans can take in movies and shows from all Disney properties, including Marvel, ABC, and ESPN. With the wide range of entertainment Disney brings to the screen, fans were left a bit puzzled when Love, Simon fans got the news that its series spin-off would be moving streaming platforms.</p><p>Streaming giant, Hulu announced that the <a href=#>Love, Simon spinoff</a>, which will now be titled Love, Victor, would move from Disney+ to Hulu. Sources <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>told </u><u>Variety</u></a> that the reason for the move was because Disney didn‚Äôt think a show that contained ‚Äúalcohol use and sexual exploration‚Äù would be appropriate for its ‚Äúfamily-friendly‚Äù Disney+ service. This explanation didn‚Äôt exactly go over well for fans of the original film.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">The former Disney+ show will go from 'Love, Simon' to 'Love, Victor'.</h2><p>The spinoff, Love, Victor follows a new student on a ‚Äújourney of self-discovery, facing challenges at home, adjusting to a new city, and struggling with his sexual orientation. When it all seems too much, he reaches out to Simon to help him navigate the ups and downs of high school,‚Äù <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>according to the Hulu synopsis.</u></a>&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>Dear Instagram, From the writers of ‚ÄúLove, Simon‚Äù comes #LoveVictor, a new story about family, friendship and finding yourself.

Not to mention that Disney owns Hulu so the seamless transition makes sense.</p><p>‚ÄúLove, Victor is funny, heartfelt and deeply affecting, and we were incredibly taken with the project,‚Äù said Craig Erwich, SVP Originals, Hulu. ‚ÄúThe show‚Äôs contemporary lens and honest storytelling make it a perfect fit for the millions of fans on Hulu who already watch and see themselves in series like Looking For Alaska, Pen15 and Grown-ish.‚Äù So with a more ‚Äúadult‚Äù feel, Hulu says Love, Victor will be right at home.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">However, fans are calling B.S. on Disney‚Äôs excuse for the platform switch.</h2><p>Disney suggests that the show will have sexual themes, but Love, Victor would hardly be the first show or film on Disney+ to feature LGBTQ+ characters or sexual situations. High School Musical: The Musical: The Series stars two openly gay characters, Carlos and Seb.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Disney+</span></figure><p>‚ÄúI‚Äôd just love to know the thought process behind putting everything on the one service when Disney has essentially two streaming options to use,‚Äù Josh Spiegel, popular television critic and Disney expert, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>tweeted</u></a>. ‚ÄúAnd why some arguably inappropriate content is OK for Disney+, but not other content.‚Äù Many fans were confused as to why The Simpsons, arguably one of the most adult cartoons of its time, is ready for anyone to stream on Disney+.</p><p>Fans are still scratching their heads as to why this switch is happening, but Disney child star and lead of the almost rebooted Lizzie McGuire had some thoughts on the topic.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Hilary Duff took to Instagram to speak about her Disney+ woes.</h2><p>Hilary, who excited an entire millennial generation when she announced her return to the Lizzie McGuire series back in August, took to her Instagram to comment on the latest Disney+ news involving the Love, Victor programming change.&nbsp;</p><p>On her Instagram story, she posted a screenshot of an article about the Love, Victor platform change and wrote, ‚ÄúSounds familiar‚Ä¶‚Äù&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>The new Lizzie McGuire series was set to follow Duff's character living life in New York City and working as an assistant to an interior decorator. Disney+ <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">announced the show was going through changes</a> and original series creator Terri Minsky, who returned for the sequel as executive producer, would be departing the show.</p><p>So was it really because of staff changes or was the Lizzie McGuire reboot also deemed not ‚Äúfamily-friendly‚Äù enough for Disney? And does that mean we can still have hope for Lizzie to move over to Hulu?</p><p>The 10-episode first season of the newly named Love, Victor is set to premiere on Hulu in June 2020.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfoby3sYysoKannmKxqr%2FNnrA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. ¬© 2022.
