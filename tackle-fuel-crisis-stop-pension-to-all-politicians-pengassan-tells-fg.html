No excuse is good enough to cripple the country,”&nbsp;he added.</p><p>Osifo stated that if there were challenges, they should be fixed, stressing that “we have a government in power to fix challenges, not to make excuses.”</p><p>He said PENGASSAN was ready and willing to collaborate with the Federal Government and assist in all ways possible to overcome the country’s present challenges.</p><p>“But we caution it not to take the Nigerian people for granted as it seems to be manifestly doing on various crucial national issues,” the PENGASSAN president stated.</p><h2>Stop Payment Of <a href=# rel=noopener>Pension</a> To All Political Office Holders</h2><p>PENGASSAN expressed dissatisfaction with the proposed increase in the salaries of lawmakers and other politicians in the country, charging the Federal Government to salvage the nation from its current state, especially with the reckless borrowing.</p><p>The union also observed that Nigeria had suffered two recessions in five years under the current administration. It noted with dismay that the workers and the poor masses had been left to bear the brunt as the economy remained in bad shape on all fronts.</p><p>“Based on the above summations, we view the recent clamour by the Revenue Mobilisation Allocation and Fiscal Commission to increase the salaries and allowances of top public office holders as highly insensitive and an affront to the struggling masses and the working class,” Osifo stated.</p><p>He added, “The only group entitled to pay rise are the downtrodden Nigerian workers and at best Nigeria judges. The President, his Vice, governors, lawmakers and other political appointees do not require pay rise.</p><p>“The Economist of London already lists Nigeria’s lawmakers as the highest paid in the world. It is therefore provocative to consider increasing their pay packages without acceptable justification.”</p><p>Osifo stressed that the union is saddened by the continuous payment of pensions to ex-governors and their deputies, even in states nearing insolvency.</p><p>“More painful is the fact that many states are not paying the N30, 000 national monthly minimum wages, whose implementation commenced in 2019,” the union’s president stated, noting that pensioners in some states have not been paid for 75 months or more with backlogs of unpaid salaries, while others deduct workers’ pension contributions and fail to remit to the pension fund administrator which by law is a criminal offence.</p><p>“PENGSSAN, therefore, demands for the stoppage of pension to all political office holders and kill any idea of further increasing their salaries until they justify such increment by first putting the economy in a proper shape and lifting millions of Nigerians out of poverty,” the statement added.</p><p>The oil workers also called on the government to heed the advice of economic and financial experts.&nbsp;It said experts had warned that “if the government continue its reckless borrowing, debt servicing will gulp over 100 per cent of the Federal Government’s revenue in about a year or two.”</p><p>Osifo stressed that the challenges at hand would only be averted if urgent steps were taken to expand the nation’s revenue base to curb the rising imbalance of the debt service-to-revenue ratio.</p><p>“The NASS ((National Assembly) we believe can still knock prudence into the 2023 Appropriation Bill, prune wastages, look deeply into service wide vote and the recurrent expenditure, and then move all cash saved to increase capital spending,”&nbsp;he added.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH5ze5BvZq2Zk6C5pnnFrpylZZOntrS10maqraegYr2mutKipqdlpKR6orjLZqeopJmptqS1wKeqZqiVo7Siv9KapWaslaG5tHnFoGY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
