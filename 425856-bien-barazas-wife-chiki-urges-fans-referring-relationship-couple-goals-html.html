Who are normal and flawed... We all have our own journeys that work for us," she wrote.<p class=align-left>Here are some of her reactions:</p><h2>Bien's take on Monogamy</h2><p class=align-left>Previously, in an interview on the Singleton Stories with Biko Zulu on <a href=#>NTV</a>, Bien was asked about how he is able to survive in marriage as an artiste.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/170371fbf90c6d40.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Latest celebrity news: Vera Sidika's marriage proposal, Erick and Chantal speak up & more</span></p></a><p class=align-left>In the video <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">shared on Facebook</a>, Bien noted he has been married for a year but still has difficulties understanding the concept of monogamy.</p><p class=align-left>The singer said it is <a href=#>still a foreign concept to him</a> in that people expect their partners to give their whole lives to them for the rest of their lives together.</p>"Don't get me wrong, for some people it works, for some it doesn't. For me as an artiste and for other musicians or just people who have startups. A startup is the same thing as art in the sense that the bearer of the vision is someone who is obsessed on their work. People who have an obsession on their work have a very difficult time making anything else that their work," he said.<p class=align-left>He lauded his wife, saying she is so different from anyone he has ever dated and nothing prepared him to be with her.</p><p>Source: TUKO.co.ke</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tcHKqGWcp16gsnCAkW5vbm5dl7amuoybmKuZqpbAbsPIn5xmm5ieuKp51Kuenqtdm66vv4yrnJ%2Bdoqe2r7OMq5ylmaSevK%2B%2Fx6KnZpufqr2tsYygppqko2O1tbnL</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
