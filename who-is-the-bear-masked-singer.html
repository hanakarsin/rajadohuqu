Keep reading to see who fans initially predicted.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Season 3 of <a href=#>The Masked Singer</a> features a bunch of fun new costumes, including an Astronaut, a T-Rex, and even a Taco. However, none of them are as cute as the Bear –&nbsp;and fans are desperate to find out who is under the bright pink, purple, and blue stuffed animal.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Wearing a furry dress and boots, viewers are convinced the mystery singer has a matching bright and bubbly personality, and have been posting their guesses to social media.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">So, who is the Bear on 'The Masked Singer' Season 3?</h2><p>In case you need a reminder, host Nick Cannon revealed that "Between them, they have one Guinness world record, three New York Times bestsellers, and 36 Gold Records," while describing the accolades of the Bear's group.&nbsp;</p><p>The Bear also sings Sir Mix-A-Lot's "Baby Got Back" —&nbsp;another clue that fans are holding onto.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Some people are convinced the Bear is Tiffany Haddish.</h2><p>From that short clip of the Bear singing "Baby Got Back," tons of fans concluded the person behind the mask is actress/comedian Tiffany Haddish.&nbsp;</p><p>And you know what? We can totally hear it. There's a bit of raspiness the Bear's voice, which is similar to Tiffany's. Plus, Tiffany's book The Last Black Unicorn, was a New York Times bestseller.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>"Is Tiffany Haddish the bear on Masked Singer? Shut uppp," one fan tweeted before another added, "She’s also got a bestselling book I believe I would put my money on her as the Bear."&nbsp;</p><p>But let's not forget that last season fans were pretty sure Tiffany was hiding <a href=#>under the Flamingo costume</a>. That turned out to be Adrienne Bailon.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Others have guessed the Bear is YouTube star JoJo Siwa.</h2><p>Or, could the Bear on The Masked Singer possibly be <a href=#>YouTuber JoJo Siwa</a>? Personally, We're not hearing the similarity in vocal tone between that few-second clip and the "Shallow" singer. But many Twitter users think she's a solid guess.&nbsp;</p><p>(She also has a New York Times bestseller, JoJo's Guide to the Sweet Life: #PeaceOutHaterz). "I may be tripping here," one Twitter user wrote, tagging JoJo. "The bear sounds like you from@MaskedSingerFOX."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Still others think the Bear could be Melanie Martinez.</h2><p>Over on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Masked Singer&nbsp;subreddi</a>t, some fans think the Bear is singer Melanie Martinez. And one user actually had some solid reasoning to back it up. "On IG bear was described as a 'Teddy Bear,' a song she sings," they pointed out. "Bear has a very stuffed animal like appearance, and that’s kinda Melanie’s whole thing, the whole childlike aesthetic." Makes sense to me.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>Meanwhile, a Twitter user was skeptical about the possibility — even if they wanted it to be true. They tweeted, "People really think the bear is Melanie on The Masked Singer? I mean that would be amazing but it probably isn't."</p><p>Do you have any guesses about who the Bear might be on The Masked Singer?
