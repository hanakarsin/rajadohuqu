Peacock has previously offered new subscribers a 7-day free trial of their services, which was the "loophole," of sorts, but the company discontinued that offer in 2021.</p><p>The only remaining "loophole" to access Peacock Premium (and Wrestlemania) without directly paying for it is by already paying for and subscribing to a certain Xfinity internet plan. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Peacock's website</a>, certain tiers of Xfinity or Cox WiFi customers are given a premium plan with the service for free, so check to see if that deal applies to you.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Is 'Wrestlemania 39' free once you're subscribed to Peacock?</h2><p>When subscribed to Peacock Premium or Premium Plus, viewers will have unlimited access to all things Wrestlemania, as well as the large variety of other shows and movies available on the service. Given that NBC has exclusive rights to air all things WWE, it is highly unlikely that an authorized stream of the event will appear anywhere else except their network.</p><p>WrestleMania 39 will stream exclusively on Peacock on Saturday, April 1 and Sunday, April 2, 2023.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnby4edOoZLCZpJi1bsPRnqqtpJWirq%2B1wGadqKpdm7%2BmsQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
