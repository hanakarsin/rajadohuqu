After two seasons, she left the show to pursue her music career. Cardi released her single “Bodak Yellow" after several mixtapes, which shot the Bronx native to stardom.

Several months later, Cardi announced on Saturday Night Live that she was pregnant with their first child.</p><p>The power couple welcomed a daughter, <a href=#>Kulture Kiari Cephus</a>, in July 2018. Despite raising their daughter, Cardi and Offset nearly ended their marriage. In September 2020, the Party With Cardi star filed for divorce from her husband and asked for “primary physical custody.” According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">BBC</a>, Cardi felt their marriage was “irretrievably broken” at the time.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Cardi B (@iamcardib)</a></p></figure><p>Eventually, the couple found their way back to each other.

Cardi <a href=#>announced her pregnancy</a> at the 2021 BET Awards in June 2021.</p><p>Cardi later said that the news came as a shock to her and Offset due to their busy schedules. (In addition to Kulture, the Migos rapper also has three children from previous relationships.) Nonetheless, Cardi expressed her excitement about being pregnant again.</p><p>"We just started laughing like, 'Lord, we have so much to do,'" she recalled in a live interview in July 2021, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>. "There is something so dear about this pregnancy, and I feel like I'm starting a new chapter, and I'm happy about that."</p><p>In September 2021, she and Offset welcomed their baby boy.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Cardi B reacted on Twitter after receiving some backlash for posting a photo of her son.</h2><p>Though had she flaunted her baby bump after her pregnancy announcement, Cardi kept several details about her son private, including his name.
