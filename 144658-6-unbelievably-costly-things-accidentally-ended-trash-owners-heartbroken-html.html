Well, these people turned their treasure into the trash! They managed to dispose of a fortune in one hasty gesture!</strong></p><p><strong>A bag full of money!</strong></p><p>One woman did not really trust the banks, so she kept all her life savings in a bag. She got old and started to forget things. In one of the declutter attempts she just threw away the old bag full of money! When the family contacted the garbage men, they were told the money is gone and buried in a huge pile of trash! The old lady lost over 12 000 UK pounds.</p><p><strong>A very special book</strong></p><p>Even Joan Rowling had no idea her Harry Potter novel would become a best seller. One of the first journalists to interview the writer was Nigel Reynolds. That took place when her very first book was just printed. She sent him a signed copy as a present. The man threw it into the trash bin putting no real value on the gift. He regrets it bitterly now, as the book’s value rose to over 50 000 UK pounds!</p><p><strong>A lousy cleaner</strong></p><p>A man wanted to be kind to his wife and arranged a surprise cleaning party for their 23rd anniversary. Little did he know how it would end! Throwing things away he accidentally got his hands on the wife’s golden jewelry hiding place and discarded it! The worth of the “golden toys” amounted to over $50 thousand.</p><p><strong>The diamond hater</strong></p><p>One staff worker of a company made an unforgivable mistake. The person accidentally disposed of some diamonds and their value was over 5 million dollars!</p><p><strong>A costly apple</strong></p><p>A woman bought one of the first Apple computers manufactured by Steve Jobs back in 1976. Surely, it got a bit outdated, and she got rid of it. The recycling worker found it and sold for over $ 200 000. He tried to find the headless lady to refund her!</p><p><strong>Lack of patience and the winning ticket</strong></p><p>A lady stood in a line to submit her ticket numbers in Las Vegas.
