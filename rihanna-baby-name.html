"The sun is on the north node, so he's probably going to be famous too. I think he’ll be creative and artistic. I don't really get music vibes just because the moon is in Libra ... He could be a fashion designer.”</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>It's possible little RZA will give Fenty a run for its money in the future, if his astrological chart has anything to do with it.</p><p>With his Taurus and Libra placements being ruled by Venus (in Aries, no less), he's going to be "a real go-getter."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"Mercury is retrograde in Gemini in the chart, so he is going to be someone who does things a little bit backwards, and takes some time to kind of find his groove," Lisa says. "He’s going to be really successful, but the only caveat is that he might be a little bit insecure … He's just going to seek more attention from his dad."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What is Rihanna's due date for baby No. 2?</h2><p>Now that we know the name of Rihanna's first kid, it's time to start speculating about baby No. 2!
