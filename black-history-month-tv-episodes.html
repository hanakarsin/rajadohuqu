Many of them had TV episodes centered around BHM, which was first legalized in February 1986.</p><p>Here are 5 of the best TV episodes about Black History Month that are available to stream!</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">5. ‘Black-ish’ (Season 5, Ep. 19: “Black History Month”)</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>8561. <a href=#>#blackish</a> "Black History Month" - I love the Octavia Spencer cutaways in this, especially the Ben Carson one. A pretty funny ep w/some good messages that are awkwardly thrown in there. Not one of their better "special" episodes. (B-) <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/bWq1XhS7iJ</a></p>— Zach Wilson (@televisionaryZW) <a href=#>July 15, 2022</a></figure><p><strong>Where to stream: </strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Hulu</strong></a></p><p>For eight incredible seasons on ABC, <a href=#>Black-ish</a> candidly discussed issues about the Black community. Using humor in the classic Black-ish way, Season 5 showed how, despite years of new Black history being made, there is still a limit to what schools highlight.</p><p>In “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Black History Month</a>,” <a href=#>Dre (Anthony Anderson)</a> takes the Black education into his own hands when he discovers <a href=#>Jack (Miles Brown)</a> and <a href=#>Diane (Marsai Martin)</a> are seemingly getting the same BHM trivia he received growing up. The patriarch spends the rest of the episode orchestrating his own facts he believes students need to know.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">4. ‘The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air’ (Season 1 Ep. 17: “The Ethnic Tip”)</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: HBOMax</a></figure><p><strong>Where to stream: </strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>HBOMax</strong></a></p><p><strong></strong>Season 1 of <a href=#>The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air</a> often showed how utterly different <a href=#>Will Smith (Will Smith)</a> was from his Bel-Air prep school classmates. In episode 17, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">“The Ethnic Tip,”</a> Will realizes his new school doesn’t have a Black history class and is shocked when his <a href=#>Aunt Viv (Janet Hubert)</a> offers to teach the class.</p><p>During her time as the class’s teacher, Aunt Viv taught her students about important Black history moments, including the Underground Railroad. Fans will recall Will leading a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ridiculous version of “Wade in the Water”</a> in one of the episode’s scenes.</p><p>While the episode aired in January 1991, one month before Black History Month, it is still a popular TV episode to rewatch.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">3. ‘Moesha’ ( Season 4, Ep. 12: “Life Imitating Art”)</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Netflix</a></figure><p><strong>Where to stream: </strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Netflix</strong></a></p><p>In <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Moesha Season 4, Ep. 12</a>, “Life Imitating Art,” the <a href=#>Brandy-led show</a> shed light on the growing divide between minorities in the ‘90s.</p><p>During the episode, Moesha led Crenshaw High’s students to protest Antonio’s (<a href=#>Jon Huertas</a>) painting. Antonio, a Mexican-American student, created a mural featuring Mexican-American migrant workers, which offended Moesha and the Black student population. But when someone defaced Antonio’s mural, the students came together and realized how much history their ancestors shared.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">2. ‘The Proud Family’ (Season 1, Ep. 15: “I Had a Dream’)</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Happy Black History Month from Oscar Proud✊🏾 <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/8pR6jHKFTL</a></p>— 🌻hoecialist🌻 (@maritzagisele) <a href=#>February 1, 2023</a></figure><p><strong>Where to stream: </strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Disney Plus</strong></a></p><p>During <a href=#>The Proud Family’s first run</a>, the Disney Channel series celebrated Black History Month in Season 1.

She travels back to 1955 and sees firsthand how divided the world was back then. When she returns in 2001, Penny gains a new appreciation for her history.</p><p>The Proud Family episode continues to be a fan-favorite today. Oscar’s iconic message about the holiday being “the shortest month of the year” remains a viral meme to this day.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">1. ‘A Different World’ (Season 5, Ep. 11: “Mammy Dearest”)</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: HBO Max</a></figure><p><strong>Where to stream: </strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>HBO Max</strong></a></p><p><strong></strong>Like all of the shows on our list, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">A Different World</a> still receives flowers for its influence on Black culture. The series, which took place at the fictional Historical Black College/University (HBCU) Hillman College, often pushed the envelopes for shedding light on actual issues affecting Black students, including HIV/AIDS, colorism, and racism.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>After learning the difficult news about her family’s history, Whitley tried to step away from the exhibit.
