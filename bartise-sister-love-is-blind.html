Namely, Bartise's sister, Amalia Bowden.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>When the topic of abortion and pro-choice is brought up on the show, Amalia, Bartise, and their mother have different opinions than Nancy does. And, while an argument doesn't ensue, it seems to be a strike against Nancy for her husband-to-be's sister.</p><p>It's possible that things change from this point forward, but it's not looking great with some fundamental differences standing between Nancy and Bartise.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who is Bartise's sister on 'Love Is Blind'?</h2><p>Unlike her brother, Amalia found love outside of reality television.

She hasn't said anything about Love Is Blind on Instagram, though, and she seems to prefer to keep her life separate from that of her brother's when it comes to reality TV.</p><p>But fans aren't letting her off the hook that easily. There's the <a href=#>conversation about abortion</a>, wherein Amalia gets visibly upset and brought to tears at the thought of Nancy choosing an abortion if she were to become pregnant and learn her baby had malformations or severe debilitating disabilities. There's also the line Amalia says about Nancy being beautiful "in [her] own right."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>While some Love Is Blind fans on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reddit</a> took this to be a slight, others argued that the conversation was likely edited.

And it's a conversation that eventually leads Bartise to tell producers that his sister doesn't approve of Nancy.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Bartise trying to weaponize his sister/family’s tears to convince Nancy to rethink her stance on abortion is wild.
