Prior to this career, he graduated from Georgetown University with an English degree in 2016. Benito began uploading&nbsp;short videos to&nbsp;his Instagram account, which eventually attracted more than 672,000 followers.

Kourtney wrote “Kendall, would it fill you to put on some f-cking makeup?!”&nbsp;</p><p>There was no comment from Kris, so we'll update you on that later.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>A few highlights on the video were the hair and makeup, especially Benito wearing the Kris Jenner wig. He also nailed Kourtney's tone of voice and facial expressions while saying things like, "Kim is just being really rude" and "Mason is turning 10 for the 12th year in a row."&nbsp; LOL.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Benito's coming-out story inspired him to do comedy.</h2><p>Benito's success started when he came out as gay when he was in college.&nbsp;</p><p>"I came out my senior year of college," he told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">USA Today</a>. "It just kind of felt like everything I had hidden for so long from myself and from the people around me and from the Internet just kind of like flooded. It came out of me."</p><p>Comedy was his outlet to embrace himself and gives credit to social media for his success.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Benito credits social media for his success.</h2><p>The YouTube star spoke about social media creating different avenues for new voices in comedy.</p><p>"I know that there's a lot of critique of them," he said. "But, as a creator and as a queer creator, Instagram and Facebook and these platforms have been an amazing vehicle for me to post videos so that I don't have to audition for something and kind of wait to be a character. I can explore different characters and write them myself."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>The girls are fightinggg 🤼‍♀️🤼‍♀️🤼‍♀️ (link in bio for the full sketch 👹👹👹)</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>Benito Skinner</a> (@bennydrama7) on Apr 9, 2020 at 5:41pm PDT</p><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>"I'm also always impressed because I think a lot of the people who are coming up on the Internet are women.
