Here are seven interesting facts about the BBC sports presenter that you need to know:</p><h3>1. She was born in England</h3><p class=align-left>Tanya was born on 3rd January 1977 in England as Tanya Ann. She grew up in the Yorkshire countryside of the country. Her parents and grandparents raised her. However, their names have not been mentioned anywhere in the public domain.</p><p class=align-left>Tanya is very secretive when it comes to her personal life. She has revealed very little information about her family to the public. It is assumed that she could be the only child to her parents since she has never mentioned her siblings in any of her conversations.</p><p class=align-left>She is of British nationality and attended Sevenoaks School, one of the selective co-ed independent institutions in Sevenoaks, Kent. She later joined the University of Warwick for her tertiary education and graduated with honours.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/96c18294804e0284.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who is Kay Adams dating now?

Tanya loved playing cricket and Rugby since her childhood</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/5fba3e432f2be68d.jpeg><p class=align-left>Tanya has been a big fan of sports, especially rugby. Her passion for the sport has been evident since she was young. She also liked playing cricket and engaging in any other sports-related activities. For her, Saturday afternoons only meant one thing - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Grandstand</a>.</p><p class=align-left>Due to the nature of her passion, she was tomboyish when growing up. She later confesses to feeling bad for her mother since she had not fulfilled her desire to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">behave and dress like a girl</a>. Tanya started understanding her mother’s desire for her to <a href=#>wear makeup</a> and dress like a girl. However, the sports presenter said she would still be happier in a pair of jeans and a sports shirt.</p><h3>3. She worked in various radio stations before joining the BBC</h3><p class=align-left>Tanya began her career by freelancing through various radio programs in the United Kingdom. She gained steady popularity and grabbed the interest of most news enthusiasts because of her deep voice.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/9f4410d7ebb96694.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Vanessa Kingori: The story of Kenyan-born British Vogue Publishing Director</span></p></a><p class=align-left>When she appeared on television during a sports event coverage, she caught the attention of a BBC producer who thought she would make the best fit for a program he intended to air. The producer probed her career background thoroughly and met with her several times before offering her the job as a sports presenter at BBC.</p><p class=align-left>Over the years, she became a familiar face on the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">BBC Look North</a> television program. She has also served as part of the BBC Sports Rugby League team for several years. It was until 2012 that she was appointed as the Super League Show presenter. She took over the position from Harry Gration. As of 2020, she was one of the longest-serving Look North sports presenters to host the show.</p><h3>4. Tanya Arnold is married and has children</h3><p class=align-left>Is Tanya Arnold married? Yes, she is. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Sources indicate</a> that Tanya Arnold's husband is Derm Tanner, her long-time boyfriend, and college-mate.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/206a76df1ee6fd43.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Marie Pierre Bouchard: quick facts about the Just For Laughs star</span></p></a><p class=align-left>There is no specific information about when the two got married although some sources say their wedding took place in June 2012. The two still share an excellent bond.</p><p class=align-left>She has two children with her husband, although there is no detail about Tanya Arnold’s son or the other child. The presenter is one of the few personalities who have managed to sustain an excellent career and personal life at the same time.</p><h3>5. She is not transgender</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/96c18294804e0284.jpeg><p class=align-left>Being among the few successful female sports reporters in a man’s career has seen Arnold cope with various aspects of criticism. In 2012, someone created a public thread on the transatlantic public forum <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">citing Tanya as transgender</a>.</p><p class=align-left>On the thread, various reasons for considering her a man were listed. Most of the contributors stipulated that she had thrived as a sports presenter due to her manliness.</p><p class=align-left>Tanya worked with her management team to deny these allegations by giving medical evidence of her pregnancy and children. Although she never commented about the issue, she publicly stated that her desire to watch and engage in sports activities began in her childhood.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/a233ced6d08fad6d.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Holly Green: 10 facts about the weather presenter</span></p></a><h3>6. She loves being recognized for her work rather than what she earns</h3><p class=align-left>Although most celebrities pride in disclosing their net worth to the public, the case is different for Tanya Arnold. So far, she has kept details about her salary and net worth from the media. She is also yet to reveal any information about what she owns – be it houses or cars.</p><p class=align-left>It is thus quite difficult to determine her exact net worth. However, journalists’ salaries in the United Kingdom vary based on experience. An established journalist with at least five years of experience gets approximately £25000 per year. One with at least ten years’ experience gets between <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">£35000 and £40000</a>. Since Tanya has been serving in the field for many years, she may be among the best-paid journalists.</p><h3>7. Tanya has served as a presenter and reporter of the Rugby League</h3><p class=align-left>Aside from working as a presenter of regional news for the BBC Look North network, Tanya also serves as a pitch-side presenter and reporter for the Rugby League. She has previously covered the Rugby League World Cup, as well as the Challenge Cup. She documents her experiences on her <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Twitter account</a>.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/cde1c7b414ed382b.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Eilidh Barbour: 5 things you didn't know about the sports presenter</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Tanya has presented weekly network and regional Rugby League highlights in the Super League Show since 2012. She has also served as a sports presenter for News Channel and <a href=#>Breakfast News</a>. She has also reported and presented for Radio 5 Live’s Rugby League in a show which features sports interviews, reviews, and news.</p><p class=align-left>From these facts, it is clear that Tanya Arnold has a track record of success as a sports presenter specializing in the rugby game. Her style, presence, and knowledge of the game are derived from the fact that she has been a fan of rugby since she was a young girl.</p><p class=align-left><a href=#>Tuko.co.ke</a> has created a list of all the <a href=#>BBC World Service presenters</a>. If you love the show and would like to know the presenters better, then the guide should come in handy.</p><p class=align-left>BBC World Service is one of the longest-running shows that has seen many presenters over the years.
