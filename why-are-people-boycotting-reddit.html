Source: Getty ImagesSince its launch in 2005, Reddit has seen its fair share of controversies. The online platform has been home to plenty of popular discussion threads, including the ever-entertaining AITA Subreddit where folks discuss moral quandaries as well as threads dedicated to our favorite shows and movies. However, Reddit as a whole has been at the center of several online incidents that have landed it squarely on the side of infamy over its long lifespan."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The online platform has been home to plenty of popular discussion threads, including the ever-entertaining <a href=#>AITA Subreddit</a> where folks discuss moral quandaries as well as threads dedicated to our favorite shows and movies. However, Reddit as a whole has been at the center of several online incidents that have landed it squarely on the side of infamy over its long lifespan.</p><p>Reddit has inadvertently given platforms to several controversial figures, allowing <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">climate change deniers</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">COVID-19 conspiracy theorists</a> to spread misinformation across the internet. People also use it as an outlet for transphobic, racist, and alt-right rhetoric to which the team at Reddit has been notoriously slow to respond.</p><p>Users and moderators are now <a href=#>boycotting</a> Reddit in light of its new policies. Here's what you should know.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Why are people boycotting Reddit?</h2><p>In early June 2023, an official statement in the redditdev subreddit <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">announced</a> a major "API Update" for large scale applications.</p><p>The statement says, "As of July 1 [of this year], we will start enforcing rate limits for a free access tier, [which is] available to our current API users." As a part of these new limits, Reddit <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">plans</a> to roll out premium paid access for third-party apps to access "additional capabilities, higher usage limits, and broader usage rights."</p><p>According to many moderators, this essentially means Reddit's new policies and pricing will render many third-party apps that use Reddit "permanently inaccessible to users." Unofficial apps that improve the user experience for Reddit are popular among folks who use the platform regularly, but they probably won't survive the new paywalls that Reddit is looking to enforce. As such, many popular subreddits are "going dark" until Reddit addresses the backlash.</p><p>The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Save3rdPartyApps subreddit</a> laid out the plan in full in a post. Starting on June 12, several subreddits participated in a platform-wide blackout. While some plan to return after 48 hours, others will reportedly "go away permanently unless the issue is adequately addressed."</p><p>"We do what we do because we love Reddit and we truly believe this change will make it impossible to keep doing what we love," the post reads.</p><p>There's a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">full list of subreddits</a> participating in the boycott.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Boycott Reddit June 12-15. Killing 3rd-party apps is just one of many last straws that users have. The "official" app is shit. It's bloated. It doesn't work well. And it's ad after ad after ad. No 3rd party apps, & I'm done with Reddit. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/OwQ8wl2Ejl</a></p>‚Äî The Pope of Chilitown (@HouTxPensFan) <a href=#>June 5, 2023</a></figure><p>We reached out to the team at Reddit, who have since attempted to clarify some aspects of their new API policies and what they mean for third-party apps. They stated that "the vast majority of API users will not have to pay for access" and that "the Reddit Data API is free to use within the published rate limits so long as apps are not monetized."</p><p>Nevertheless, the team also seems dedicated to hearing the demands of concerned parties in the wake of their new policies.</p><p>"We're in contact with a number of communities to clarify any confusion around our Data API Terms, platform-wide policies, community support resources, and timing for new moderator tools," Reddit told Distractify.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">When will Reddit be back up?</h2><p>‚ÄúA significant number of subreddits shifting to private caused some expected stability issues, and we‚Äôve been working on resolving the anticipated issue,‚Äù Reddit told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NBC News</a> after the site appeared to be down.</p><p>So, it looks like the whole protest has created a pretty big fire to put out over at Reddit HQ.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>All the good subreddits have gone private/dark in protest. I can't even be mad because I need to spend less time on reddit.

Users who visited the site were greeted with an empty front page that read: ‚ÄúSomething went wrong. Just don‚Äôt panic.‚Äù During this time, Reddit users couldn't see posts or explore the site further.</p><p>However, as of June 12, the site if back up and running. In fact, it only took about two hours for the Reddit team to get everything working again.</p><p>As for the protests and subreddits itself, there isn't a clear answer as to when we'll see normalcy on Reddit. The general plan was just a 48-hour period, but like most demonstrations, plans can change in real time. Plus, some moderators are already saying that they'll go longer if necessary.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecCrnGaolaS9rbGMm6aym5%2Bpwaq6xmapnpyUnsFw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. ¬© 2022.
