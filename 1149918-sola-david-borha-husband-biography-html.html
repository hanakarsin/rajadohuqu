She expressed a desire to come back to Nigeria for career prospects and ended up working at NAL Merchant Bank by the advice of her good acquaintance Atedo Peterside.

But she is sure she will never forget her amazing experience, and this really helped her to shape her personality.</p><p class=align-left>When Sola David Borha speaks about her high position and success, she says that she is happy that women in IBTC did not meet career ceiling and were encouraged to work further, so the company had a lot of women who held the high positions. Sola says that this approach is exemplary to the banking industry and approves of breaking the gender stereotypes.</p><p class=align-left>Sola David Borha thinks that her greatest achievement in the entire career was being a part of the management team which helped IBTC to develop into the leading financial company in Nigeria.

Apparently, Sola David Borha is succeeding in keeping her family away from public eye. However, she once shared an emotional story about her husband during the church service.</p><p class=align-left>According to Sola David Borha, for a long time, she was not considering getting married because she set her career first. One day, she helped out a fellow pastor by allowing him to stay at her home, and later he told her that he noticed the lack of a mirror in her bathroom. He then said that she will have to buy one because her husband will have to shave. Apparently, Sola thought it was a joke and laughed it off. But coincidentally, the pastor’s words came true: she met her future husband when she was 36 years old. Now they have children together, and Sola David Borha is sure that everything happens according to God’s plan. This is also her advice to young people who want to get married.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/vllkyt6bladk30h4r.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>5 famous Nigerian transgenders and their stories</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/f3dbddf32fb09035.jpeg><p class=align-left>Sola David Borha is an amazingly hardworking woman who showed us nothing is impossible and the sky is just the beginning.
