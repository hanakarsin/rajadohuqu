I was curious to hear the episode was "dedicated" to Mike Mendel.&nbsp;</p><p>So, "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">who is Mike Mendel?</a>" you might be wondering. While he happens to have been a behind-the-scenes star, you are 100 percent familiar with a large majority of his work.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Who is Mike Mendel from Rick and Morty? His work is seriously legendary.</h2><p>Mike, (birth name: Joel Michael Mendel), worked on a wide range of cinematographic projects that you've definitely heard of. In addition to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">producing 22 episodes of Rick and Morty</a>, he's produced a total of 207 episodes of The Simpsons, and even got his name on the 1996 drama Jerry Maguire, according toThe Hollywood Reporter.&nbsp;</p><p>In his lifetime, Mike has achieved an impressive total of four Emmy Awards. So, it's safe to say he's slayed the game.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">He married a famous casting director.</h2><p>That's right &nbsp;— Mike married famous casting director <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Juel Bestrop</a>, (who has worked on major titles such as Brooklyn Nine-Nine and Life in Pieces).

And although the cause of his death has not yet been released, his wife, Juel, has informed the masses that he died due to "natural causes." Apparently, he passed comfortably in the couple's Southern California home, according to Heavy.</p><p>And since he worked on the show, his colleagues felt it would be appropriate to release Season 4, Episode 1 in his honor.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>It's finally happening.
