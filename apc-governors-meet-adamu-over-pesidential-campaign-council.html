We cannot make meaningful progress without them in the affairs of these states, particularly in an election year that is approaching.</p><p>“We cannot plan without the buy-in of our governors so that we can stand together, believing that we share the same aspirations. We will plan together to see how best we can deliver the interest of the party and ensure that victory is ours in the 2023 general election that is by the corner. That is the essence of this meeting.”</p><p>Reacting to Adamu’s invitation for the meeting, Lalong, who stood in for Chairman of the Progressive Governors Forum, Atiku Bagudu, said they found it heartwarming to return to the party after the last convention.</p><p>“We are very happy our party is moving well. Today we have an invitation of the national chairman and that invitation also went to the campaign council. So the Progressive Governors Forum invited the campaign council to a meeting and that is why you can see the meeting came jointly with progressive governors (who) are also part of the campaign council for proper briefing.</p><p>“When we were coming in, some governors were confused because they have not visited your office since you renovated it. We use this opportunity on behalf of governors to congratulate you. This is the real office of the party in government. I wish some people will see and others will come and copy from us. Once again, I want to say we are here at your instance and also at your invitation.”</p><p>The development is coming barely 24 hours after a strategic planning committee of the Tinubu-Shettima Presidential Campaign Council <strong><a href=#>met behind closed doors</a></strong> in Abuja on Tuesday evening.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH5xe49uZpqok2K0sMLEq6WoqqNiuqax02aYnZmdqnqwwsSrZKmdo56xprrTopilZZOWurGtyKClZpufqruktcto</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
