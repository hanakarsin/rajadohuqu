Source: InstagramAfter spending over a year (as of this writing) dealing with the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, every time word breaks out that someone is sick, the same question is on everyone's mind: Is it the coronavirus? 
Thankfully, more and more vaccines are rolling out each and every day, but there are still tons of people who are waiting for their potentially life-saving shots."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

So when Cardi B expressed that she was suffering from health issues on a recent IG live, fans were initially worried.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Thankfully, Cardi B's health issues weren't COVID related.</h2><p>The "Up" artist went on IG with a face mask, sunglasses, and a wrapped towel over her head, telling her fans that the reason she wasn't on Instagram Live for a while was that she was dealing with stomach issues that were so severe she had to visit the hospital.</p><p>She said, "Yesterday, I was on Twitter, right, and one of my fans asked me, 'Oh, why you haven't gone on live?' And I told her like, 'Yo, I went to the hospital b---h. I was sick.'"</p><p>She continued, "I was weighing at least 130 [pounds] and now I'm back to weighing 124. Like literally I weigh 124 because I was throwing up my f--king life away, man." She went on to say that she ate peanut butter with yogurt and four bags of cotton candy to try and regain the weight.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>So what was the cause of her illness? Whatever it is, it's not the coronavirus, according to Cardi B's publicist. Cardi went on to say, "And then today my publicist hit me up like, 'Oh, I just wanted to tell you like ain't nothing coronavirus-related or something.' Thank God."</p><p>So it's not COVID, but Cardi didn't elaborate on what her health issues actually are. I'm assuming that in addition to handling her media queries, Cardi B's PR person is also handling all of her medical reporting, too.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Cardi B made headlines in 2019 when discussing her health as well, but for different reasons entirely. The Bronx native swore off of plastic surgery for good after she had to cancel a string of shows due to health issues that arose after constantly going under the knife.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Cardi B vows that she is done with plastic surgery ✌️ <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/XRe4Equo22</a></p>— iHeartRadio (@iHeartRadio) <a href=#>June 18, 2019</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>.<a href=#>@iamcardib</a> is reportedly featuring on <a href=#>@theweeknd</a>’s Save your tears (remix), after her looks for the video have leaked.</p><p>The star is yet to confirm she received additional plastic surgery to match the look of The Weeknd. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/j34VUE4pQh</a></p>— nicki chart data (@chartdatanm_) <a href=#>February 9, 2021</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion performed "WAP" at the 2021 Grammys on a set that looked like a giant bed.</h2><p>Cardi B kicked off the performance with a trippy, projected art show that contained some flashes of Andy Warhol-meets-H.R. Giger imagery for her song "Up." Then, the performance transitioned into the arrangement for "WAP" and Meghan Thee Stallion walked onto the stage to perform a duet of the popular 2020 single.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-fyFmx rJYJh"></figure><p>The set for the routine was intricate and they performed a variety of suggestive moves on top of a cartoonishly oversized bed. After the performance, Trevor Noah came out on stage and quipped that he dreamt of being in bed with Cardi B and then his grandmother came running into the bedroom and scolded them for wearing shoes on a mattress.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Who ever cardi b hairstylist is deserves a Grammy too, because what! <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/StLlNnQcxp</a></p>— Sucre mamito ☘️(I sell wigs) (@MissSorinola) <a href=#>March 15, 2021</a></figure><p>Cardi has recently also lamented about her inability to shoot a "proper" music video these days and she doesn't feel right doing a video with "one of them hood videographers." She also responded to fans who asked her to put out new music stating that she doesn't "want to put out a song right now."</p><p>She did go on to say that the only song she'd be interested in putting out right now is "like a really calm song."&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmK6zsMhmmWaglZa5tbSMoqqsrZWo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
