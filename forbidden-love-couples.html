Mohammad's twin brother didn't want him to marry Ashley because he is Muslim and she is a conservative Catholic. The couple also deals with Mohammad's yearning to convert their daughter, Rozie, to the Muslim faith, though she has her reservations about it due to the strict Muslim laws.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Kris and Lensa</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TLC</span></figure><p>Lensa and Kris's relationship affects not just them, but their families. Kris, the son of a Pentecostal preacher, is dealing with judgment from his dad for falling for Lensa, a Muslim woman who has been in two arranged marriages. To make things even murkier, Lensa and Kris want each other convert to each other's religions. Will one of them leave their religion entirely, even if it means never speaking to their family again?

However, she quickly learned it wouldn't be a smooth transition, as she has to mourn the loss of many aesthetic things like clothes, changing her hair, etc. Only time will tell if the changes makes or breaks the relationship.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Lindsay and Elmer</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: TLC</a></figure><p>While Lindsay's religion is unclear, Elmer left his Amish country behind to marry her. However, Elmer has trouble navigating the "English" world paired with being disowned by his family for also leaving them as a consequence to converting. Lindsay also deals with realizing her "wholesome" husband may have a wandering eye and feels he might be too much for her. Unfortunately, she has this thought while also being pregnant with Elmer's baby!</p><p>Forbidden Love airs new episodes on Sundays at 10 p.m. EST on TLC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfm7yzrsidm56mXaG8t7GMnKauqJyawA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
