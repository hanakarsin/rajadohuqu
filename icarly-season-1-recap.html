The iCarly revival from Paramount Plus has been praised for being one of few revivals in 2021 to get the material right. The show follows a grown-up Carly (Miranda Cosgrove), Freddie (Nathan Kress), and Spencer (Jerry Trainor) alongside new friends Harper (Laci Mosley) and Millicent (Jaidyn Triplett) as they navigate social media and adulthood."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Carly is now an adult, and she lives with her college roommate Harper in Seattle. Her older brother, Spencer, is now a wealthy artist living in the loft they shared in <a href=#>the original show</a>. Freddie has also returned to Seattle following two failed marriages to live with his mother, and he is accompanied by his 11-year-old stepdaughter, Millicent.</p><p>In the show's pilot, Carly decides to revive her web series iCarly after her ex-boyfriend Beau starts a web show with his new girlfriend. Carly receives help from Freddie, Spencer, and Harper, who provide camera work, emotional support, and styling services, respectively. However, the internet is a much different place than Carly remembers.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Paramount Plus</span></figure><p>Throughout the first season, the friends deal with hilarious situations such as accidentally going viral, getting temporarily canceled, and running into exes and former enemies. The group also encounters multi-level marketing schemes, cultish workplaces, sex workers, new love interests, and breakups.</p><p>In Season 1's final episode, titled "iReturn to Webicon," Carly and her friends are invited to a secluded island to celebrate a lifetime achievement award from Webicon. If fans of the original show will recall, Webicon was the event that Carly, <a href=#>Sam</a>, and Freddie attended in the Season 4 episode "iStart a Fanwar."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Paramount Plus</span></figure><p>Sadly, this new Webicon event doesn't go as planned, and not only is the gang out of accommodations, but the only other person on the island is Carly's ex-boyfriend from the pilot episode, Beau. During the episode, Millicent and Spencer help a depressed Freddie pitch a start-up idea to Beau, while Harper shares her romantic feelings for her former boss and fictional pop star Double Dutch (Poppy Liu).</p><p>The episode ends on a cliffhanger where Carly's current romantic interest, Wes, and ex-boyfriend, Beau, confess their feelings to Carly. A helicopter rescues the group from the island before Carly can decide who she wants to pursue a relationship with, thus ending Season 1 on a cliffhanger. The question remains: Who is Carly Shay's next boyfriend?!</p><p>Season 2 of the iCarly revival premieres on April 8, 2022, exclusively on Paramount Plus.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnrCivsuyZKydkai8r3mQZqmem5Gl</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
