They are the building blocks of the economy. Economists divide the factors of production into land, labour, capital, and entrepreneurship. What are the characteristics of labour as a factor of production?</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/1120/55224f4557ed504a.jpeg><p class=align-left>The term labour refers to the efforts exerted by humans to produce the final goods and services. What is meant by labour as a factor of production? It is all types of human efforts, including physical, mental, and knowledge exerted to get an economic reward.</p><h2>Characteristics of labour as a factor of production</h2><p class=align-left>The importance of labour as a factor of production can be seen in any production company or industry. Without workers, the<a href=#> company </a>can be dead. Employers understand this and try to make the working environment suitable for any employee.</p><h3>1. Labour is not continuous in production like machines</h3><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/33579f468953d79e.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>10 best African countries to live and work in 2020</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Unlike machines, labourers cannot work round the clock. The body needs to rest and recharge before resuming work. Failure to allow rest will lead to less productivity. A labourer is entitled to leisure and personal time. Machines can be overworked, but human labour does not operate in the same manner.</p><h3>2. Labour is perishable</h3><p class=align-left>Unlike other commodities, labour is more perishable than other factors of production. You cannot postpone nor keep labour to use in the future. Labour cannot be stored. Think of an unemployed worker; their labour is lost on the day they do not show up to work. When time is lost, so does the labour.</p><h3>3. Calculating the cost of labour production can be a challenge</h3><p class=align-left>It is not easy to calculate the cost of production of labour. An employer can calculate the cost of production of a machine. He, however, cannot do the same for the production of a labourer. This can be compared to parents that are raising children. They cannot fully calculate the total cost of raising the children even when they include school fees, health care, food and clothes.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/9fc6af29b8c6e4b5.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The 20 least marketable courses in Kenya in 2024 (updated)</span></p></a><h3>4. You cannot separate labour from the labourer</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/33579f468953d79e.jpeg><p class=align-left>For any service or product to be sold, the labourer must be physically present. This limits sales when the labourer is not around. Labour and the labourer are inseparable. Take a carpenter, for instance. A carpenter cannot sell his furniture if he stays at home. He has to be physically present at the workshop to sell his products.</p><h3>5. Labour has no tangible form</h3><p class=align-left>Just like labour has no standard or reserve price, labour production also has no tangible form. You can see the end product of the labourer's work. You can also touch the product or feel it. You can see the labourer at work, but you cannot see the labour.</p><h3>6. Human effort</h3><p class=align-left>Labour is directly related to human effort. An employee that is treated right, given time to rest or work on other things will function differently from an employee that does not get such benefits. The effort given will determine the amount of work done.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/18ea90441d70670b.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Everything you need to know about quantity survey course in Kenya</span></p></a><h3>7. Labour is heterogeneous</h3><p class=align-left>Labour is one of the significant factors of <a href=#>production</a>, and no worker is the same as the next. Human beings are made differently. They are unique and have a variety of things to offer. One employee may be more skilled than the next, while others may be fast. The work environment is also an important factor in determining productivity.</p><h3>8. Labour has a poor bargaining power</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/9fc6af29b8c6e4b5.jpeg><p class=align-left>You cannot store labour. It also lacks a standard price. Labourers will work for <a href=#>minimum wage </a>as their bargaining power is weak. This is worse when he or she has nothing to fall back on. The worst affected are individuals that are paupers or not well informed.</p><h3>9. Not easily mobile</h3><p class=align-left>Labourers can move from one site to the next, but the effect their movement will have will be massive. There are a number of barriers that can be frustrating. This will also fall on the employer. Labour is not as easily mobile as other factors of production.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/0fgjhs3fc8o61rhqtg.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Civil engineer salary and job description in Kenya</span></p></a><h3>10. Labour supply can be inelastic</h3><p class=align-left>Time and again, labour supply in the market gets to be inelastic. The demand may increase, but the supply of human labour may not amplify to match the demand. A construction site may be looking for construction workers for a set of buildings. The completion period for the buildings may be defined, but the supply of labour may not be achieved in a week, month or expected period.</p><p class=align-left>Now you have the top characteristics of labour as a factor of production. Both employees and employers need each other for quality end products. Human labour is necessary even with the introduction of machines in various industries.</p><p class=align-left><a href=#>Tuko.co.ke</a> published a post on<a href=#> job groups in Kenya</a>, salaries, and allowances according to SRC. Suppose you hope to get employed by the Kenyan government, or you're already a civil servant, it is wise to be familiar with the updated list of job groups in Kenya and their salaries.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/de7b24ddb8525812.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Current minimum wage in Kenya 2024/2025 and recent updates</span></p></a><p class=align-left>This may come in handy for your plans and tame your expectations.
