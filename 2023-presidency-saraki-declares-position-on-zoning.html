But the reality is that the northeast north-central and southeast have not had Presidency or Vice Presidency. But what I’m saying is today, where the country is, with the challenges before the country, we must bring in other issues.”</p><p>Citing the example of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Saraki said in choosing the new national chairman, the party went for a person they felt was best, suggesting that those who can solve the problems of the country shouldn’t be ruled out because of zoning.</p><p>“We did it when we wanted to look for the National Chairman of our party. we went seeking for who we felt was the best that would help the party.</p><p>“There are people who can provide solutions to the problems of the country if you give them the opportunity,” Saraki submitted.</p><p>Meanwhile, <strong>Naija News</strong> earlier reported that <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Saraki has declared</a></strong> there is a strong probability that he would be joining the 2023 presidential race.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH10e5BtZmtoYmh6sb7ErKCdnZ6Yxm6%2FwKuYpKFdmbKkuMCrnKxloKTAqsDIqKVmp55ix7C6yKeeaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
