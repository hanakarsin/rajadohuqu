Things are changing.</h2><p>Emma had to leave Wimbledon at a key moment, and the reason she couldn't continue was troubling, to say the least. The tennis star has been posting some images on social media assuring fans that she is doing alright ever since leaving the competition. In one, she elaborated on the state of her condition.</p><p>"Hi guys, I wanted to let everyone know that I am feeling much better this morning," she wrote in her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">post</a>. She congratulated her opponent and then explained what went wrong. "At the end of the first set, after some super intense rallies, I started to breathe heavily and felt dizzy. The medical team advised me not to continue and although it felt like the hardest thing in the world not to be able to finish my Wimbledon on the court, I was not well enough to carry on."</p><p>Emma added, "I want to thank the people who have cheered me on every single match, I wanted to win so badly for you! I also want to thank the All England Club, my team, the LTA, my parents, and friends. Last night will go a long way to helping me learn what it takes to perform at the top. I will cherish everything we have achieved together this week and come back stronger! Can’t wait to see what’s next on my journey."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Emma Raducanu (@emmaraducanu)</a></p></figure><p>Anne Keothavong, the former number one women's tennis player in Great Britain, explained a little bit about how Emma's doing too. Per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Sun</a>, Anne said that Emma is making great strides in recovering and that she is confident that the young athlete will be able to return to the sport.</p><p>"She's OK. She's going to be fine. Last night I saw her leave the Club and obviously, it was just a difficult situation for her to be in and for everyone to witness. But she'll be just fine," Anne explained.</p><p>The tennis champion further elaborated on the situation by touching on Emma's training. "In terms of her preparation, her and her team did everything exactly the same," she explained. "They prepared exactly the same as they do for her other matches. She purposefully stayed over at Aorangi instead of practicing on the main courts before her match just to stay out of the public eye. They did everything they could to prepare her as well as they did."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">What happened to Emma that caused her to withdraw? She had a troubling on-court moment.</h2><p>Right in the middle of her fourth round at Wimbledon, facing off against Ajla Tomljanovic, Emma began showing signs that something was wrong. Her usually robust performance began to falter seemingly as she struggled with something internally.</p><p>After losing her first set 6-4, Emma's condition visibly worsened. Eventually, she made the call to withdraw, citing difficulty breathing as the reason for her decision.</p><p>Despite having a pretty rough experience at the competition, Emma seemingly hasn't let the loss or withdrawal deter her too much in life. Between confident statements from peers and her own shows of good health online, it's clear Emma won't be out of the picture for too long.</p><p>On July 5, 2021, the star posted an image of herself watching a televised race on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a> accompanied by the caption, "The Sunday routines that don’t change…"</p><p>We wish Emma luck in her recovery and future endeavors!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmrqurYyrmJ2tk5a7tnnHnpilrJhiwrGwwK2c</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
