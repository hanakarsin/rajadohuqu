She appeared in a variety of films and movies from a young age, even acting in the classic slasher film Halloween. Her resume is as solid as her career as an actress, but her time as an OG cast member of<a href=#> RHOBH</a> has cemented her in Bravolebrity history. Since the series began in 2011, Kyle has been a staple member of the cast, but she’s been dropping hints that she will be leaving RHOBH for greener pastures.</p><p>Kyle Richards’ acting career began in 1974, but her reality TV career actually started prior to RHOBH. She appeared in three episodes of her niece <a href=#>Paris Hilton</a>’s reality series The Simple Life, and also appeared in a few episodes of the competition series I Want To Be A Hilton, which was hosted by her half-sister, Kathy Hilton in 2005. She joined the cast of RHOBH in 2010 and has been a member of said cast since. After 13 Seasons, why do some think Kyle is leaving the cast?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Is Mauricio Umansky the reason Kyle Richards might be leaving ‘RHOBH’?</h2><p>Kyle’s marriage to <a href=#>Mauricio Umansky</a> had become tabloid fodder prior to the premiere of the 13th Season of RHOBH. Kyle and Mauricio got married in 1996 while Kyle was pregnant with their <a href=#>daughter Alexia Simone</a>. Kyle had been married prior to Mauricio and had a daughter, Farrah Brittany, with her first husband. Kyle and Mauricio had two more daughters after that, Sophia and Portia. When RHOBH began in 2010, the couple still appeared to be very much in love with each other.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Mauricio (Mau) (@mumansky18)</a></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">When did things change in Kyle and Mauricio’s marriage?</h2><p>When the rumor mill began to buzz with news of their potential separation, fans of the series were taken aback. The couple, after all, still seemed strong at the beginning of 2023. Mauricio even made a loving post about Kyle on her birthday and again nearly a month later on Valentine’s Day. Both posts referred to Kyle as his “Queen.” In fact, it was not until a few months later that rumors of cheating began to circulate about both Kyle and Mauricio.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Did Kyle cheat on Mauricio?</h2><p>There were a few instances of rumors going around that Mauricio was <a href=#>cheating on Kyle</a>. Some people alleged that he and <a href=#>Dorit Kemsley</a> were having an affair, something both parties vehemently denied, and there wasn’t much proof. Kyle was also accused of infidelity after some eagle-eyed social media followers noticed a major shift in her activities. She was rumored to be dating country music star <a href=#>Morgan Wade</a>.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Kyle Richards is focused on health, sobriety, and happiness, which are difficult to maintain as a Real Housewife.</h2><p>Kyle has remained tightlipped about her supposed relationship with Morgan, and according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">E! News</a>, it is not certain that she and Mauricio will follow through with a divorce. Whether in a new relationship or not, Kyle shared that it was her decision to end things with Mauricio and that she is focused on happiness. She has also shared with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bravo</a> that pursuing her happiness means leaving Beverly Hills. Her statement heavily implies that leaving Beverly Hills also means leaving RHOBH.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnsBut9ilnGaqmZi1or7DrGSlnZGrtq%2BzjKufqJqY</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
