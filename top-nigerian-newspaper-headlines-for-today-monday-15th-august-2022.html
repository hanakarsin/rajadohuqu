August 2022</h2><p>The Inspector-General of Police, IGP Usman Alkali Baba has given fresh marching orders to police operatives to provide adequate security across the country.</p><p>The Police boss gave the directive in a statement on Sunday through the Force Public Relations Officer, Olumuyiwa Adejobi.</p><p>He charged operatives to respect the rights of Nigerians and avoid unprofessional behaviours.</p><p>A copy of the statement obtained by Naija News revealed that the IGP “ordered the deployment of water-tight security arrangements to cover all schools, hospitals, health workers, and critical national infrastructures around the country.”</p><p>The IGP has equally ordered regular patrols, stop and search, raids, and show of force by tactical commanders to clamp down on pockets of crime and criminality recorded in some states of the federation.</p><p>It is understood that IGP Baba gave the directive while reviewing the general security situation of the nation via reports from commands and formations across the country.</p><p>The Minister of State for Labour and Employment, Festus Keyamo has declared that he won’t be resigning his ministerial position because of his recent appointment as the spokesperson for the All Progressives Congress Presidential Campaign Council.</p><p>Keyamo argued that the two roles can be combined effectively without anyone suffering or being neglected, adding that he has not broken any law by combining the roles.</p><p>Naija News reports Keyamo made his stand known on Sunday in response to calls from a civil society organization for him to resign his ministerial position.</p><p>It is understood that the Transition Monitoring Group (TMG) on Sunday through its chairman, Awwal Ibrahim Rafsanjani, had asked him to resign his ministerial appointment as combining it with his new role may result in a conflict of interest.</p><p>But in a statement he personally signed on Sunday, Keyamo described Rafsanjani’s position as a sign of jitters in the opposition camp.</p><p>The Minister accused the group of being a support group for the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) but only pretending to be a Civil Society Group.</p><p>The Deputy National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, (North-West), Salihu Lukman on Saturday said that there are moves to reconcile aggrieved members of the party.</p><p>According to Lukman, the presidential candidate of the party, Bola Tinubu has reconciled with some aggrieved presidential aspirants in the party.</p><p>The former Director General of the Progressive Governors Forum said Tinubu after the presidential primary met with some of the presidential aspirants.</p><p>The likes of Former Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, Senate President, Ahmad Lawan and several others have been silent on the activities of the party.</p><p>He stated that he expected the presidential candidate to pick the aggrieved members as part of the consultations going on for the campaign council.</p><p>Lukman expressed hope that the campaign council after being put together will accommodate the aggrieved members and there would be unity.</p><p>A notorious Boko Haram Commander, Aminu Duniya, has reportedly been killed after two Nigerian Air Force (NAF) fighter jets bombarded terrorists in Niger State.</p><p>The airstrikes which occurred on Saturday reportedly left many terrorists feared dead, Naija News understands.</p><p>It was gathered that elements had gathered at Kurebe in Shiroro Local Government Area, hosted by Duniya.</p><p>Duniya was said to have invited the terrorists to his enclave at Kurebe to the meeting, which attracted numerous terrorists, who came in large numbers on their motorbikes.</p><p>According to PRNigeria, Kurebe is a known terrorist haven as local inhabitants of Kurebe have since vacated the villages in and around the area after terrorists drove them away in 2021.</p><p>According to a NAF intelligence operative, though their bombardments eliminated many terrorists, it remains unclear if Duniya was neutralized.</p><p>Labour Party presidential candidate, Peter Obi, has urged Nigerians to avoid politics based on religion and tribalism in the upcoming elections.</p><p>Speaking on the upcoming election via his verified Twitter handle, the former governor of Anambra state said that the current state of the nation calls for everyone to come together and shun tribe and religion.</p><p>He asked Nigerians to vote for candidates whose portfolios show that they can get the job done.</p><p>The Ghanaian High Commission in Nigeria has refuted the alleged letter written by the nation’s President, Nana Akufo-Addo about the 2023 presidential election in Nigeria.</p><p>Naija News recalls a letter which surfaced last week had claimed President Akufo-Addo asked the All Progressives Congress (APC) Presidential flag-bearer, Bola Tinubu to step aside for the Labour Party (LP) Presidential candidate, Peter Obi.</p><p>The said letter claimed Tinubu needed to take care of his health and should therefore step down for Obi</p><p>However, the Ghanaian High Commissioner to Nigeria, Mr Rashid Bawa on Sunday denied any such letter. This comes days after President Akufo-Addo had also debunked the letter.</p><p>Bawa stated that Nigeria and Ghana have always maintained the principle of non-interference in the internal political mechanisms of other countries, hence there is no iota of truth in the purported letter.</p><p>The campaign organisation for the presidential candidate of the African Action Congress, Omoyele Sowore has berated the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, over his comments on the ongoing Academic Staff Union of Universities, ASUU, strike.</p><p>Naija News recall that on Friday the PDP flag bearer at a youth programme to commemorate International Youth Day 2022, stated that he was not pleased with the ASUU strike while also condemning the All Progressives Congress-led government for their inability to resolve the strike.</p><p>Atiku insisted that such a situation would never occur in his administration.</p><p>Reacting to Atiku’s declaration via a statement signed by the Spokesperson for Sowore 2023 Presidential Campaign organisation, Onyinye-Gandhi Chukwunyere, the group noted that such a statement claiming that an ASUU strike would never occur in his administration was a “reflection of Atiku’s dishonesty with the Nigerian people.”</p><p>The Miyetti Allah group has charged Fulanis in Nigeria not to vote for the presidential candidate of the Labour Party, Peter Obi in the 2023 general elections.</p><p>The group in a statement released on Sunday described the former Governor of Anambra State as a ‘tribal bigot’.</p><p>According to Miyetti Allah, Obi has the interest of Biafran which would not favour Fulanis in the country if he emerge as president in 2023.</p><p>The National Secretary-General of the Fulani socio-cultural group, Saleh Ahassan lay the allegation against Obi in an interview with Punch.</p><p>Miyetti Allah further stated that Obi should not be considered for the presidency in the forthcoming election.</p><p>The National Vice Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Dr Salihu Lukman has said that it is a destructive culture for the Federal Government to pay lectures despite being on strike.</p><p>Naija News reports that Lukman shared his opinion on the strike during an interaction with journalists on Sunday in Abuja.</p><p>The APC chieftain insisted that it was high time to regulate the conduct of ASUU in a way that would benefit the younger generation.</p><p>He condemned the inadequate funding of the educational sector insisting that no country advances through private funding of public education.</p><p>He blamed the romance of the Ibrahim Babangida regime with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank policies which imposed the Structural Adjustment Programme which he said led to the collapse of investment in education.</p><p>A former Nigerian Ambassador to the Philippines, Yemi Farounbi on Sunday said Nigerians were warned in 2014 against voting for Muhammadu Buhari as president.</p><p>According to Farounbi, Nigerians entered one chance when they voted for Buhari, the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress in 2015.</p><p>Farounbi further stated that President Muhammadu Buhari is God’s punishment for Nigeria.</p><p>The former Ambassador stated this while speaking on a radio programme in Ibadan, Oyo State capital.</p><p>He expressed optimism that Nigeria will get better, adding that Buhari can still redeem his image by becoming Nigeria’s best president.</p><p>Farounbi said he would only redeem his image if he could sincerely restructure the country into six geographical zones.</p><h2><strong>Those are the top Nigerian newspaper headlines for today.
