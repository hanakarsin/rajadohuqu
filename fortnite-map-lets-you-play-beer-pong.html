Developed by CodeD3V, the quirky map is technically called Slurp Pong—but it’s essentially beer pong with a Fortnite coat of paint.</p><p>In Slurp Pong, you’re tasked with using a grappling hook to swing your way across a giant table and land in massive plastic cups on the other side of the map. The other team, meanwhile, is doing the exact same thing but in the opposite direction.</p><p>The map is arranged like a standard beer pong table — complete with tacky lawn furniture and overgrown plants — and the first team to successfully land in all 10 of the enemy team’s cups is the winner.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Epic Games via Twitter</a></figure><p>It’s not a true, one-to-one replica of beer pong, but this is probably as close as you can get with Fortnite.</p><p>If you’re interested in checking out Slurp Pong for yourself, you can dive into a beer pong match using the map code <strong>3534-3819-2430</strong>. The map supports up to three other players and is designed to be a 2v2 experience.</p><p>The innovative game mode seems to be gaining a bunch of fans, with Fortnite players on Twitter praising the hilarious map.</p><p>“This might just be enough for me to come out of [Fortnite] retirement,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote one user</a>. Another chimed in saying, “This is why no game will ever beat Fortnite… It’s like a million games in one.” That last statement became truer than ever with the launch of <a href=#>Creative 2.0</a>, which gave players tons of new ways to experiment and develop their own games using Fortnite.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>New Map! 🏐 Slurp Pong 🗑️</p><p>Map Code: 3534-3819-2430</p><p>😎 Grapple, swing, and land your baller into the cups to score points.<br>🏆 The first team to land in all 10 cups wins!<a href=#>#UEFN</a> <a href=#>#CreatedinFortnite</a> <a href=#>#Fortnite</a> <a href=#>#FortniteCreative</a> <a href=#>#creative2</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/wTTTGUCoek</a></p>— CodeD3V (@CodeD3V) <a href=#>June 14, 2023</a></figure><p>CodeD3V is no stranger to making hilarious maps. The developer recently launched a “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">meme map</a>” that has players navigating a map of floating cookies — jumping from one to the next without any safety net. It’s a bit like the <a href=#>OnlyUp Fortnite map</a> (only this one includes a lot more chocolate chips).</p><p>The creator also launched a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Firework FFA</a> map just in time for the Fourth of July, which allowed players to battle it out using Flare Guns and Bottle Rockets.</p><p>The beer pong (or Slurp Pong) map seems to be the most popular map developed by CodeD3V, and it’s picking up a lot of steam on social media. It was even recently featured directly in Fortnite, which led to a huge jump in popularity for the map.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>This guy made beer pong in Fortnite 😂</p><p>Calling it slurp pong <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/OArow1QXdK</a></p>— Jake Lucky (@JakeSucky) <a href=#>July 4, 2023</a></figure><p>It’s unclear if CodeD3V will expand on Slurp Pong to take advantage of its newfound popularity, but it’s obvious that they’ve already got a winner on their hands. And if you’re heading back to campus in the next month, this is a solid way to start warming up.</p><p>Remember — use the map code <strong>3534-3819-2430 </strong>to check out the Fortnite beer pong map for yourself. Be sure to round up a few friends too, as the chaotic action is best experienced with three other players.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfm7yzwM2iq55lnZa9brjErapmsZ%2BqerG4wLJkm52Vp3qxu82g</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
