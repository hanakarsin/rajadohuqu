There are two main fish farming systems: extensive and intensive systems.</p><p class=align-left>Extensive system: as an example, we can mention a pond or irrigation ditch system. The main feature of such system is that it is installed in a semi-natural environment, with a natural food supply to the cultured fish. The farmer can regulate the environment of the pond with the help of different fish species and special equipment.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/fc839ae7359a6a1b.jpg><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Business plan for fish farming in Nigeria</p><p class=align-left>There is also such type of extensive system of fish farming as "re-stocking" of natural populations. In this method, the fish is raised in tanks and then it is released in the wild to feed, but recaptured after receiving marketable size.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/2c03453a939471ac.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Incredible types of farm machinery you need to know</span></p></a><p class=align-left>As for the intensive system of fish farming, this can be, for example:</p><ul><li>Completely closed system that is called integrated recycling system</li><li>Flow-through/raceway that is called semi-closed system</li><li>Open system that is called floating cage system</li></ul><p class=align-left>Often farmers use closed-circulation tanks or flow-through raceways in such types of systems. There is also floating sea cages, that are open to the natural environment, and they are also related to intensive systems.

Most of the closed-circulation tanks are equipped with water purification systems.</p><p class=align-left>The intensive system is considered as a high-cost method of fish farming, but it provides much higher rates of productivity. The disadvantage of this system is that the stocking density can become the factor that increases the risks of diseases among fishes.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/cd544b4df7738319.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Did you know how important fish farming is for Nigeria?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>There is also one more system that is called “flow-through system” it is also known as classic fry farming, in this system the species of the fish are raised in tanks and then released.</p><h2>Fish farming in Nigeria</h2><p class=align-left>Fish farming is among the most popular businesses related to agriculture in the country, and there are a number of reasons for such popularity, for example:</p><ul><li>The fish meat is a popular product;</li><li>Fish is a known source of protein and a number of other important elements for our health, including Omega-3;</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/c6aa2c9cb375ab36.jpg><ul><li>Fish is the product that can be sold quite fast;</li><li>Most fish species matures quickly;</li><li>Fish farming hasn’t environmental hazards.</li></ul><p class=align-left>All these reasons support the profitability of fish farming.
