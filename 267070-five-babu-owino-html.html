Babu Owino humble beginning</strong></h2><p class=align-left>Paul Ongili is a successful political figure and businessman with several investments under his name. Despite his current lifestyle, it is worth noting that Babu Owino comes from a humble background. Mr Ongili's mother had to odd jobs including selling fish among others to fend for Babu Owino and his siblings. It is presumed that such hardships molded Babu into the person he is today as he has evolved into a vibrant, determined, and a bold political figure.</p><h2><strong>3. Babu Owino Biography</strong></h2><p class=align-left>Babu Owino was born in Nyalenda Slums in Kisumu. Babu has always been an intelligent student ever since as he scored 394 marks out of 500 earning a place at the Mang'u High school which is one of the best National schools in the country.
