"Sometimes I think maybe I should be a lesbian… because men are so hard to find," the influencer teased during an episode.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TLC</span></figure><p>"I would like to find someone that’s not young, but not old," she continued. "He is handsome. He’s tall. He’s skinny. He’s geeky. He has more than the physical — I like the men that are smart."</p><p>When a friend offered to set her up on a blind date, Larissa agreed, telling the camera, "It’s very important to me to find a relationship that I can feel stable. I would like a good guy that I can build my life [with]. I’m hoping the man that I [find] can be very hot and also American."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Larissa admits that she still has feelings for Eric in a clip from '90 Day Fiancé'.</h2><p>In <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a trailer</a> highlighting the rest of the season, Larissa confesses to her shocked ex that she isn’t over him.

Shortly after they went their separate ways, Larissa filed a police report against him for harassment.&nbsp;</p><p>She claimed to have received taunting text messages and phone calls following their split, some of which were allegedly sent by women who got her number from Eric. He denied Larissa’s allegations in a lengthy statement to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Us Weekly</a>.</p><p>"I’m not surprised my ex made up something to file a police report against me to get my attention," he said. "I went on about my own business leaving town, then received texts from her about a bunch of nonsense that is an essay long."</p><p>Eric also placed part of the blame on Larissa’s friend Carmen, telling the publication, "She’s the mastermind manipulator who filled Larissa’s head with confusion and suggestions of leaving me for men with money." He added that police had not contacted him about the complaint.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>In an October interview with Us, Larissa didn’t mention the alleged harassment when talking about <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">her breakup</a> with Eric.
