As the saying goes in the Seven Kingdoms, all men must die, and that's certainly been apparent throughout the past seven seasons of Game of Thrones. We've seen dozens of characters meet their end in some gruesome ways, and even at times found ourselves delighting when a particularly heinous villain gets their just desserts."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

We've seen dozens of characters meet their end in some gruesome ways, and even at times found ourselves delighting when a particularly heinous villain gets their just desserts.&nbsp;</p><p>I'm not proud of it, but I get a thrill and a warm feeling when I think about Petyr Baelish's comeuppance. And I also know I'm not the only GoT fan looking forward to the almost certain death of <a href=#>Cersei Lannister.</a></p><p>For years, the Queen has topped Arya Stark's kill list, and now that <a href=#>the Night King has been killed by Arya Stark </a>(sorry, spoiler alert), it looks like Cersei is next. With so many people eager to take her out, it seems to be only a matter of time before one succeeds.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">So, who will kill Cersei?</h2><p>While the outcome of this season is a tightly guarded secret, that isn't stopping fans from speculating how some major plot threads will be tied up. And the future as it pertains to Cersei is definitely one of the major topics of discussion. There are two dominant camps —&nbsp;Team Jaime and Team Arya — though some other compelling, if less popular, theories are also in the mix.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Theory 1: Jaime kills Cersei</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: HBO</span></figure><p>The Kingslayer becomes the Queenslayer? The predominant theory about how Cersei will meet her end is attached to the prophecy told to her by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Maggy the Frog</a>, who already correctly predicted all of Cersei's children would die before her. The theory Jaime will do his sister in comes from this line from the prophecy: "And when your tears have drowned you, the valonqar shall wrap his hands about your pale white throat and choke the life from you.</p><p>"Valonqar" is the High Valyrian word for "little brother," so Cersei has always assumed Tyrion was the person this line alludes to. It's one of the many reasons she hates the Imp. However, a few theories suggest Tyrion is actually the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">illegitimate son of Aerys "The Mad King" Targaryen</a>. This would certainly explain Tywin's hatred of his youngest son, but it would also mean he's not necessarily the Valonqar Maggy spoke of.</p><p>Also, let's remember that prophecies tend to be vague by design, and Cersei was technically the firstborn, even if her twin came shortly after. Therefore, whether or not Tyrion is a secret Targaryen, Jaime could still technically be called her "little brother."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Theory 2: Arya kills Cersei</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: HBO</span></figure><p>No two people in Westeros have a greater reason to hate Cersei than Arya and Sansa. They witnessed their father's execution at tender ages and know Cersei and her son, Joffrey, are responsible. Since the two worked together to take down Littlefinger, some fans on reddit propose they will team up again to take down their greatest foe.</p><p>Whether or not Sansa is involved, the <a href=#>prevailing Arya theory i</a>s sort of a Best of Both Words approach: wherein Arya kills Cersei while wearing Jaime's face. It's not 100 percent clear whether the Faceless Men can wear the faces of the living or if Jaime must die first to allow for this outcome. Either way, most fans who like Arya for the murder think she'll be masquerading as a Lannister man when she does.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Theory 3: Tyrion kills Cersei</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: HBO</span></figure><p>You have to admit, it would be somewhat gratifying if Cersei met the very end she's spent her entire life waiting for and yet still managed to be blindsided. Tyrion definitely has plenty reason to hate his sister. I personally don't love this theory, but it would be adequately poetic.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Theory 4: The Hound kills Cersei</h2><p>This theory is mostly upheld by fans who've been waiting in vain for "<a href=#>Cleganebowl</a>." This fan theory stems from the rivalry between Sandor "The Hound" Clegane and his much MUCH older brother Gregor "The Mountain" Clegane. Folks had hoped when Cersei was arrested that she'd choose a trial by combat with the reanimated corpse that is The Mountain as her champion. The prediction was that The Faith Militant would put up The Hound as theirs, allowing Sandor to finally get revenge for the disfigurement and the years of abuse he suffered at his brother's hands.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: HBO</span></figure><p>This theory also fits in well enough with the "Valonqar" prophecy. After all, Maggy didn't specifically say it would be Cersei's younger brother.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Theory 5: Cersei will die in childbirth.</h2><p>Another way Cersei may fulfill this portent is if "valonqar" refers to the youngest brother in the Lannister line. If she is indeed <a href=#>pregnant</a>, and the child she's carrying is a boy, then <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his arrival could bring about her end</a>, much as her mother died giving birth to Tyrion. To make things even more apt, some fans theorize that incest and/or alcoholism could cause her fetus to have dwarfism, just like the brother she hated her whole life.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWwedaio6Vlm565rXnCnqmsnZlitKK5xGamn2Wknb%2BwusSs</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
