Gus and his father live in the forest, but after his father dies, Gus must embark on a journey to safety with a man named Tommy Jepperd, aka <a href=#>Big Man</a> (Nonso Anozie), to reach a sanctuary for hybrid people like himself. The series starts in Yellowstone National Park but eventually expands into a cross-country trek.</p><p>In Season 2, we see Gus and his gang make it to Colorado, and later embark on a mission to Alaska to find his mom, Birdie (Amy Seimetz). The third and final season of Sweet Tooth concludes with Gus, his hybrid friends, Jepp, and Becky returning to Yellowstone where they build a new home.</p><p>The series closes with an old Gus (played by <a href=#>James Brolin</a>) telling his story to a group of young hybrids. At this point, Jepp and Becky are no longer in the picture as it is hinted they lived out the remaining years of their life until only hybrids are left.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Sweet Tooth (@sweettoothnetflix)</a></p></figure><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Cinemaholic</a> notes that in July 2020, the New Zealand Ministry of Business, Innovation, and Employment (MBIE) permitted several productions to shoot in the country, even though travel was mostly barred due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

According to a Vertigo Comics interview with Sweet Tooth creator Jeff Lemire, he based Jepperd on an aged Frank Castle. Frank might be more familiar to fans as the Marvel vigilante The Punisher.</p><p>"The protagonist’s aging gray-haired Frank is amazing to behold and truly an unstoppable force of nature," he said.
