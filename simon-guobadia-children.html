The pair married in 2019 and announced their divorce on April 22, 2021. Shortly after Simon and Falynn announced their split, Simon began dating Falynn's friend Porsha Williams.&nbsp;</p><p>Simon and Falynn, who both had children from previous relationships, shared a blended family of eight children between them. Though there is some conflicting information online, it appears that of those eight children, Simon is the biological father to five: Quentin, Nicole, Christian, Benjamin, and Ximena.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Falynn and Simon announced their split on April 22, 2021, but he had reportedly first <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">filed for divorce</a> back in January. Both parties are successful in their own right, with Simon, in particular, reportedly having an <a href=#>estimated net worth of $40 million</a>. Simon is the CEO of Simcol Petroleum, LLC, but he is also a restaurant owner and even executive produced a few films, such as&nbsp;Son of the South.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Simon's youngest child Ximena is currently 8, and his oldest, Quentin, is 25. On June 2, 2021, Simon's 57th birthday, he&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">posted to Instagram</a>&nbsp;and captioned a photo of his family with this sweet message: "Blessed and thankful to be celebrating another birthday. I don’t take my life and blessings for granted. Spending with my kids makes it even more meaningful.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>At one point, there were rumors that&nbsp;<a href=#>Porsha and Simon were expecting a baby</a>, but Porsha has since put those rumors to bed. She cut right to the point on May 18, 2021, saying, "I am not pregnant. This is not a shotgun wedding." Both Simon and Porsha have children from previous marriages, so it could be unlikely they add to their group anytime soon. Maybe down the line, they will have children together, but until then, fans will have to wait and see.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Porsha and Simon's engagement has been the subject of much debate on the internet, but one thing is for sure: They're happily in love and celebrating life as a family.&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Page Six</a>&nbsp;reports that Porsha explained to&nbsp;Dish Nation&nbsp;that due to Simon's Nigerian heritage, the pair are not going to have just one wedding, but three!</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"He’s African, so we’re going to have a native law and custom ceremony, and a regular wedding, and then we’re going to have another wedding at one of the houses that is out of the country," Porsha explains. In the same interview, she also revealed she had a tattoo of his name on her neck, clearly a sign of deep devotion and care for the relationship.</p><p>It sounds like the pair are having the best time, and perhaps fans will see more of their blended family in the upcoming season of&nbsp;The Real Housewives of Atlanta.
