When you put on your TV at 10am, he will be 500km away from where you met addressing Kenyans, being made an elder of that community...that is why to me, you are a wonderful organiser," said Atwoli<p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Court gives Meru woman KSh 25.6 million for hospital negligence during delivery</p><p class=align-left>He went ahead to mention and expound on the meaning of popular nicknames Kenyans have given the Opposition leader in honour of great works he has done.</p>"He has been given several nicknames which include Agwambo meaning the mysterious one. Raila is also often described as the enigma in Kenyan politics," the unionist gushed.<p class=align-left>Atwoli spent close to 15 minutes showering the African envoy for infrastructure development with praises and admiring his origin, wondering how the country would look like without his presence.</p>"Barack Obama's father come from the same county as Raila Odinga. Sometimes people ask, if that county was not in Kenya, where would we get the opportunity to meet these wonderful people?" he posed.<p class=align-left>Raila who later addressed the trade unionists from across the continent called on African leaders to foster peaceful co-existence to enhance economic growth.</p><p class=align-left>He further seized the opportunity to condemn the ongoing xenophobic attacks in South Africa urging political leaders to rise up and take action.</p>"African leaders must rise up and take action. It is not enough to just condemn xenophobic attacks in South Africa. It is very painful to watch Africans attacking their fellow Africans. It is sad to watch Africans burning and looting businesses owned by their fellow African brothers," said the Opposition chief.<p class=align-left><strong><i>Do you have a groundbreaking story you would like us to publish?
