Source: BBCThere’s a new reality competition series coming to Netflix, and Win the Wilderness does not disappoint. Picture a whole of Survivor with a side of Alaskan Bush People and The Amazing Race. While it reminds us of existing shows we know and love, it’s definitely got a vibe all its own."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The mountain was named (by Duane) in 1986, once they chose the spot for their property. The Ose home features sweeping southern views of Mt. Denali.</p><p>“The earth here comes from an ancient Birch forest, giving us a fertile soil nested in a sheltered bowl protected from the North winds. Our massive log home is built on a ridge which my wife Rena and I live within our means, off-grid and created a new life,” Duane shares in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a personal blog post</u></a>.</p><p>But the cast wasn’t cozy on the mountain the entire time.</p><p>“Filming for the show was arduous as the distance between Duane and Rena's house and the wilderness camp was nearly 200 miles apart by road and air,” shares popular British news source <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>inews.co.uk</u></a>.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>A view of #osemountain from the south, as we are banking round to the airfield. #winthewildernessalaska #duaneandrenaose #alaskalife.

The idea is to see how they can handle some of the real situations they’ve faced in their 30 years living off-the-grid.&nbsp;</p><p>“Provided with canvas sheets, ropes and minimal instructions, the couples must use the surrounding forest to build the shelters they will live in during their time in the Alaskan bush.”</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">The Oses are tough as nails.</h2><p>So it’s no surprise they want the couple who takes over their little slice of heaven to be the same.
