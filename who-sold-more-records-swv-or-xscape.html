Fans have taken their sides over time based on the results of that interaction, and the two groups are seemingly the talk of the town once again due to their recent Bravo! feature , SWV & XSCAPE: The Queens of R&B, which premiered on March 5, 2023.</p><p>So, in terms of numbers alone, who sold more records: SWV or Xscape?
