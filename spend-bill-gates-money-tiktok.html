What would you splurge on if you had that type of dough?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">TikTok users can spend Bill Gates' money on bars of gold and the Mona Lisa.</h2><p>After Isabella, who goes by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@onlyjayus</a> online, documented her time on the highly entertaining website, the Las Vegas native’s 4.3 million followers flocked to the URL to try it out for themselves. The page lets you "buy" and "sell" items such as cruise ships, skyscrapers, and even rockets.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@onlyjayus href=#>@onlyjayus</a><p>Public Service Announcement <a title=fyp href=#>#fyp</a> <a title=foryou href=#>#foryou</a> <a title=facts href=#>#facts</a> <a title=funfacts href=#>#funfacts</a> <a title=billgates href=#>#billgates</a> <a title=money href=#>#money</a> <a title=rich href=#>#rich</a> <a title=rant href=#>#rant</a> <a title=notamodel href=#>#notamodel</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - onlyjayus" href=#>♬ original sound - onlyjayus</a></figure><p>Isabella started out by buying all 32 teams in the NFL for $2.3 billion a piece. That still left Bill with $16.4 billion (out of a possible $90 billion). "He can literally own the NFL and still be a multi-billionaire!" the social media celeb said in disbelief.</p><p>"This man can buy 100 Ferraris and 100 Lamborghinis like it’s nothing. 999 Rolexes? Sure!" she added, racking up an additional $54.9 million, which is only about .04 percent of Bill’s current net worth.&nbsp;</p><p>"And then there’s me, telling myself not to buy food on my lunch break at work so I can save some money," Isabella teased, though her words hit a little too close to home.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">How does Bill Gates actually spend his money?</h2><p>The 64-year-old is the proud owner of an extensive luxury car collection, as well as a private plane that seats 19, but he and wife Melinda are best known for their philanthropic work, having given away billions of dollars to charity over the years.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Through their foundation, which was formed in 2000, the pair has donated over $36 billion in an effort to reduce inequities in healthcare, improve K-12 public schools in the U.S., and accelerate progress in advancing human development and alleviating extreme poverty.</p><p>In 2017, Bill <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">donated 64 million shares</a> of Microsoft to his charity, which were valued at $4.6 billion. It marked his largest single gift since the organization’s creation nearly two decades before. He previously gave away $16 billion worth of stock in 1999.</p><p>The software developer and his wife, along with investor Warren Buffett (who's worth $89.5 billion), also started a movement called <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Giving Pledge</a> in 2010, which encourages the world’s richest individuals to commit to giving "the majority of their wealth to philanthropy or charitable causes, either during their lifetimes or in their wills."</p><p>Over 165 billionaires have signed the pledge, including Mark Zuckerberg, MacKenzie Bezos, Michael Bloomberg, Elon Musk, and Richard Branson. That’s a whole lot of capital.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqL2musNmmaKknGK0osDErGSmp56axm7AyKSrqKM%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
