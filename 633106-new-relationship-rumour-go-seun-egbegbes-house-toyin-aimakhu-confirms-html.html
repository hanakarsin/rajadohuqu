Seun is my friend and I confide in him a great deal. If people want to judge by the pictures they see they would be misled. Everyone knows I’m a playful person by nature. And I take very suggestive pictures even more with Afeez Eniola and co than anyone else.</i></p><p><i>Contrary to speculations that I live with Seun, he stays in Ikeja and I live on the Island. I cannot deny that I come to see him occasionally. What most people did not realize was that when I had my trauma, I had just very true people that stood by me. Seun Egbegbe was one of them.”</i></p><p>Egbegbe is the CEO of Ebony films. On Monday, November 9, Toyin Aimakhu blasted people who dupe her fans with mobile data scams on her Instagram page.</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkg3R%2FkGltZqaVrHqzscuaq6Knnqi1qryMq6ymp6Wneqi7jKycrqZdmrSjscabnKxlmKTCtLGMraayoZ5irqq5wKSfrmWTpLuntdGmqmegpKK5</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
