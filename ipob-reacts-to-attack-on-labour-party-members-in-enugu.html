If IPOB wishes to do so we will make it open and Nigeria Government and its Security Agencies will hear the sound.</p><p>“Anybody or criminal groups hired for such impersonation and demonization will soon incur the wrath of IPOB volunteers and ESN operatives.</p><p>“Our intelligence unit the M.Branch intercepted the secret arrangements where some few Fulani soldiers and terrorists in Nigeria Security Agencies especially DSS and Military planned to hire some criminals to attack campaign grounds to incriminate IPOB and ESN in the East with Biafra flags and insignias and tag it on ESN members we did not attack campaign ground.</p><p>“In doing so, they forgot that IPOB and ESN will not in any way desecrate the hallowed Biafra flag in the name of political attacks. Nigeria Security Agencies keep desecrating Biafra flags any time they are carrying out their cheap and dirty blackmail against IPOB.</p><p>“Sometime last year in Anambra State, Nigeria compromised DSS arranged some hooligans and their men who stupidly displayed Biafra flags when they attacked and robbed some banks at Building Material Market in Ogbunike Anambra State to demonise IPOB.</p><p>“But they don’t know that IPOB is seven steps ahead of them. Any time they arrest any criminal they quickly go to the vault and dole out Biafra flags they have printed waiting for their blackmail. The more they do this childish blackmail against IPOB the world knew them and they display their stupidity to the global world.</p><p>“One wonders what kind of thieves will rob a person and leave their house address with their victims. That’s how daft Nigeria Government can be by sponsoring criminals to display Biafra flags and insignias.</p><p>“IPOB has made it known to the public severally that we are not interested in the jamboree selection process they called Nigeria election. Anybody linking IPOB in whatever way to this their jamboree is deluded.</p><p>“IPOB is very sure that it was Nigeria Government and her compromised Security Agencies particularly DSS and Army Personnels that sponsored some of their men with some criminal gangs they created to attack Labour Party campaign ground and made it look like IPOB volunteers and ESN operatives attack them, we are not involved.</p><p>“We are telling the public that IPOB has no hands on these criminal activities because IPOB doesn’t care what happens with demonized Nigeria politics. The Nigerian Army, and DSS agents must leave IPOB alone and focus on the jamboree jobs they are doing without protecting their citizens in Nigeria.</p><p>“IPOB is not a problem but a solution to free trapped talents and Indigenous from terrorists infested country called Nigeria. IPOB members are peaceful and focused on how to secure a referendum date the same day they do their selection process called the Nigeria election.</p><p>“IPOB is not planning only to scattering Nigeria, because we have scattered Nigeria already. What remains of Nigeria is total disintegration, every trapped Indigenous People will be free. And that we must do in a due cause so long as Chukwu Okike Abiama is backing this noble family and Biafra Movement.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH16e49wZqKon5d6s7HAnKusZaSkeqLA05qapGWfo3qtrcGorKtloJa%2FtcWMppymmpWnwG61zWacp62Xqnw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
