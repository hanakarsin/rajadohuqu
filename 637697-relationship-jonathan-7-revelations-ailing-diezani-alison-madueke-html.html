How can $20billion disappear just like that? Where did it disappear to? Is it possible that such an amount would not be traceable?

I don’t own choice properties everywhere</strong>:</p><p>According to Diezani she has been living with her husband in the same house since their marriage in 1999. She said her husband bought their house in Abuja in 2007 and she decorated it to their taste which is not over the top.</p><p>She said: “<i>Anyone who tells you I have houses anywhere should feel free to publish them. That was how they said I bought an expensive property in Vienna. I went to court and I won the case. I never saw the house before except in picture. The house I stay in London is rented. As a woman I love to look good. Some of my dresses and jewelleries are often dumped on me by those I buy from and I pay them when I can</i>.”</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkg3SDlXJuZqqVoa61tc6nqqGhoGK3sLrArZ%2Bapl1serOx1Z6jmqyZpLu0ecCio6Kml2KxqrHZmqWiZZGhtrS7zWakmpylmrimesetpKU%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
