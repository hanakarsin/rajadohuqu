Source: InstagramThough you may consider yourself a non-football fan, you've probably heard of the Academy Award-winning film, The Blind Side. The 2009 film follows the real-life story of homeless Black teen Michael Oher (played by Quinton Aaron), who is taken in by the Tuohy family. 
Leigh Anne Tuohy (played by Sandra Bullock) and her family help Michael discover his football potential, and he goes on to secure a scholarship to play football as a lineman at Ole Miss."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Here's what the former NFL star is doing in 2021.</h2><p>The 34-year-old football player was drafted by the Baltimore Ravens in 2009 as an offensive lineman for quarterback Joe Flacco. The 23rd overall pick from Ole Miss had a successful career as a lineman and helped his team make the playoffs in his first career season.&nbsp;</p><p>In the 2012 season, Michael faced-off against the San Francisco 49ers in the Super Bowl and helped his team emerge victorious.</p><p>"I came so far — from nothing to a Super Bowl championship," he told ABC News after winning the coveted Lombardi trophy. "I'm in shock right now."&nbsp;</p><p>After winning the Super Bowl with the Ravens, Michael was signed to the Tennessee Titans for just one season before he was released. The lineman played his final two NFL seasons with the Carolina Panthers.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Michael Oher (@michaeloher)</a></p></figure><p>Since retiring from the NFL, Michael has had success off the field. He created the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Good Deeds app</a>, which allows locals to connect and give back in their community to those who are struggling.&nbsp;</p><p>“It is all about connecting people who have needs with those who want to give,” he said (via the Good Deeds website). “Download the app and help a child in need beat the odds like I did. Be an answer to someone’s prayers.”&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Michael Oher is not a fan of 'The Blind Side.'</h2><p>Though The Blind Side became a box office success, the real-life Michael was not a fan of the movie.</p><p>“I felt like it portrayed me as dumb instead of as a kid who had never had consistent academic instruction and ended up thriving once he got it,” he wrote in his 2014 memoir, I Beat the Odds (via <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Biography</a>). “Quinton Aaron did a great job acting the part, but I could not figure out why the director chose to show me as someone who had to be taught the game of football."&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Michael Oher (@michaeloher)</a></p></figure><p>He continued, "Whether it was S.J. moving around ketchup bottles or Leigh Anne explaining to me what blocking is about, I watched those scenes thinking, 'No, that's not me at all! I've been studying — really studying — the game since I was a kid!' That was my main hang-up with the film.<strong>”</strong> &nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWmvsRmoKxlnZ6wqa3EpWSooJWneq%2B71mZpaWph</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
