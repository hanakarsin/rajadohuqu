They cannot feed their wives and children, send the children to school, pay hospital and electricity bills, among others, and still pay the police.”</p><p>Okoli pointed out that the Lagos State Government Traffic Law banned motorcycles and tricycles from operating, but policemen are only interested in disturbing motorcycles riders while others are allowed to work freely.</p><p>“My members do not want to go into any criminal activity, that is why they decided to use their motorcycles to make a living,” he said.</p><p>Okoli warned the police to stop extorting and intimidating members of the association who are plying the lawful routes allowed by laws of the state. He also said he was ready to produce evidence showing that policemen are extorting money unnecessarily from the commercial motorcycle operators.</p><p>Okoli also promised that he would lay down his life if that would end the intimidation and harassment usually meted out to his members by the men of the Nigeria Police Force. “The protest will be totally different from what Nigerians are used to, because it will be an everyday show, until the government responds positively to our plight,” he assured.&nbsp;</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkg3WEk2xloaydoQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
