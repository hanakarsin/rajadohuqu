But how well? And do we know her net worth?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">What is Hawk Tuah Girl's net worth?</h2><p>While we don't know what Hawk Tuah Girl's net worth is for sure — and we don't know exactly what percentage of the proceeds she's getting from her merch — we do know that as of around June 26, she'd already <a href=#>sold at least $65,000 worth of hats alone</a>. This didn't even include the sales of her T-shirts, or the fast-selling $50 signed hats with leather patches.</p><p>Based on this alone, it looks like Hawk Tuah Girl (aka Haliey Welch) is only going to see her net worth continue to rise.</p><p>As for Hailey's day job, there were <a href=#>rumors that she'd gotten fired</a> from her gig as a preschool teacher. This, of course, turned out to be a hoax from a self-proclaimed satirical website.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Tim & Dee TV (@timanddeetv)</a></p></figure><p>In fact, Haliey herself actually opened up about her real job on a podcast interview. After she appeared on stage as the <a href=#><strong>surprise guest at Zach Bryan's Nashville concert</strong></a> on June 29, Hailey did an interview with Zach Bryan's longtime girlfriend, influencer <a href=# style=text-align:start><strong>Brianna LaPaglia</strong></a>, on the Plan Bri Uncut podcast.</p><p>The internet star mentioned that after dropping out of school "a year or two ago," she had been working at a spring factory, though she mentioned she had recently quit.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Zip Recruiter</a>, the average salary for a factory employee in Tennessee is about $15 an hour, though we obviously don't know what Haliey was making.</p><p>We have a feeling that whatever Haliey is doing or decides to do next, she's going to be a hit. She's got the humor and charm to prove it.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfna64t4ytrJqgXZy2s7iMp5ytZaekv7W0</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
