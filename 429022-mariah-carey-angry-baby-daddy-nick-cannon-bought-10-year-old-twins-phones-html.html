Learning about all their new brothers and sisters, no we ain’t playing'," he said.</i><p class=align-left>Cannon said that at eight, he agreed that it was early to get them the devices but made a deal with the We Belong Together singer that he will buy the twins phones when they turned 10.</p><i>"Is 10 a more reasonable age? Mariah said ‘Uh Uh, no,' but I still got them the cellphones for their 10th birthday,” he added.</i><p class=align-left>This was before consulting his <a href=#>celebrity</a> ex-wife, and he revealed that to date, she is still mad at him.</p><i>"We had this amazing party with jump jumps, their friends came, it was so amazing. Then it was time to open the gifts, I was like, ‘I’m going to leave these right here and tell your mama I’ll be back.’ Mariah is still mad at me to this day. Mariah, forgive me," he funnily said while looking at the camera.</i><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/012edc29ef7a95c4.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Woman Shares How Bae Cheekily Dumped Her with Request for Some Space</span></p></a><h2>Cannon's children</h2><p class=align-left>The media personality recently said he is <a href=#>ready to have more kids despite having seven kids </a>with four different baby mamas.</p><p class=align-left>Cannon welcomed three babies with different women this year, including twins Zion and Zillion.</p><p class=align-left>However, he later recanted his words and said he <a href=#>wants to practise celibacy</a> as he already has enough kids.</p><p>Source: TUKO.co.ke</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tcHKqGWcp16gsnCAkXJna2pdoq6ztcChZJyZoprGbq3NoKmyZZKWr7p5w5qbnbFdo7akt4ycmKemn6N6o7vUoJ%2BtZWFlerqxwKtkqKSUYsG4tc2sZKmgn6OytHrHraSl</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
