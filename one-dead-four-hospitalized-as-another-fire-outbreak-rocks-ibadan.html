Another person, Owoseni Ajala, was rushed to Hamdalat Hospital, Ojoo. All of them are responding to the treatment except Quadri who gave up the ghost this morning (Sunday).</p><p>“I am a trailer mechanic. I do convert trailers’ steering from right to left. We called it ‘righty.’ The fire occurred at our workshop in the Badmus area. No shop was burnt down. It affected six trailers (DAF). There was one trailer we had already finished, and the owner promised to come around today (Sunday) to pick it up, it was also affected.</p><p>“I was not in the shop when the incident happened. I went to the Automated Teller Machine at Ojoo to get some cash when I received a call that fire had gutted some trailers in our shop. I quickly rushed back and before I could get there, about six vehicles had already been affected. Three were burnt down in my stand.</p><p>“We are many in that garage. We have a welder, panel beater, tuner, and many others. According to what they told me when I returned from the ATM gallery, the fire started about three cars to my own stand (shop). The late Quadri was using a generating set to work on a vehicle because there was no light, so he used it to power his machine. There was another person next to him using oxygen and gas but unknown to them, the pipe of that oxygen had burst somewhere. So, it catches fire suddenly.”&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpkZH1ze49tZqimlWKxpq3DZp2oraJitbC%2Fz6KrmqSZr7KlecCsZJqmn6m1pr6Mn6CrnV2kwrWu0Z6YpGWipLCsv4yimZqckaN8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
