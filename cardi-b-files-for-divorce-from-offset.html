In April 2018, Cardi revealed her pregnancy on Saturday Night Live. She gave birth to her daughter Kulture Kiari Cephus in July 2018.</p><p>In December 2018, Cardi B claimed that she and Offset were splitting. “I’m gonna always have a lot of love for him because he is my daughter’s father,” Cardi said at the time. Shortly after, Offset interrupted Cardi’s set at Rolling Loud with flowers and pleaded, “TAKE ME BACK, CARDI.” The two reconciled, with Offset joining Cardi on stage as she accepted her 2019 Grammy Award for Best Rap Album.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpgZH16e5BuZpyZopm2bq6Mn6ClnaNis7C%2BjJ2gr6eimLJustGopGanlpvApsCO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
