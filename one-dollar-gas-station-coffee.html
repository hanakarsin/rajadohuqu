With cold brew, lattes, macchiatos, and more often costing upwards of seven dollars, it feels virtually impossible to grab a good cup of joe without breaking the bank.</p><p>And whether it be your <a href=#>local cafe or neighborhood Starbucks</a>, the added price of syrups, sweeteners, alternative milk, etc., usually leads to a hefty bill — especially when factoring in the <a href=#>dreaded tip</a>.</p><p>Fortunately, that needn’t be the case. On <a href=#>TikTok</a>, creator <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@oktree</a> (Yoko) shared her surprising method of obtaining a large iced coffee for a fraction of the price. Here’s what she said.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok/@oktree</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">A woman shared a one-dollar gas station coffee hack on TikTok.</h2><p>Rather than hitting <a href=#>Dunkin’ Donuts</a> or an artisanal coffee shop, Yoko revealed that she frequents gas stations for refreshing caffeinated beverages. “I love my coffee, and this has saved me so much money,” the creator shared in her caption.</p><p>In her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">video</a>, Yoko walked TikTok through how she creates a Starbucks-worthy iced coffee by showing her gas station routine. First, she starts by grabbing a plastic cup and filling it with ice before selecting one of the multiple iced coffee dispensers.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@oktree href=#>@oktree</a><p>I love my coffee and this has saved me so much money ffypccoffeeiicedcoffeebbudgetmmoneyssavingssavingmoneysstarbucksddunkinmmorningroutinepprideggasstationccheapddiyddiycoffeeddesserta<a title=asmr href=#>#asmr</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - Yoko" href=#>♬ original sound - Yoko</a></figure><p>After dispensing the coffee into her cup, Yoko adds a splash of half-and-half before getting to the fun part. She then pans her camera over the multiple syrup offerings, ranging from caramel to raspberry to pumpkin pie, before adding one pump of caramel to the mix.</p><p>Upon leaving the gas station, the creator notes how embarrassing it was to record herself — but the price was undoubtedly worth it. “I don’t care because now I got a one-dollar coffee!” she exclaims.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">The woman explained how she elevates her one-dollar gas station coffee.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok/@oktree</span></figure><p>When Yoko entered her car with her newfound one-dollar drink, she explained how she typically takes things up a notch. Rather than drink the gas station iced coffee as is, the creator noted that she keeps a bottle of caramel in her car to drizzle on top before drinking it.</p><p>While she, unfortunately, misplaced her caramel, Yoko still couldn’t contain her excitement over her coffee’s price. “This is only one dollar!” she sings. “And I save so much money because I go to Dunkin’ and Starbucks a lot.”</p><p>She then pointed out that even though the two primary coffee chains have rewards programs, you don’t save much money in the long run because the apps upcharge you for using them.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Other folks agreed that gas station coffee is superior to chain coffee companies.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@oktree href=#>@oktree</a><p>Replying to @clea I’ve been getting these coffees all week!

And the breakfast food hits,” another enthusiastic person mentioned in the comment section.
