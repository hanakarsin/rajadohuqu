More on that in a moment. First, to clear the air, Emilia is joining the MCU as a different character named G‚Äôiah in the <a href=#>Disney+</a> series <a href=#>Secret Invasion</a>, which also stars <a href=#>Samuel L. Jackson</a> as <a href=#>Nick Fury</a>.</p><p>In 2019's Captain Marvel, Nick was an ally of the Skrulls, and now, Emilia plays the grown-up daughter of a resistance leader who fought with that group.</p><p>"There‚Äôs a kind of punk feeling that you get from this girl,‚Äù Emilia told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Variety</a> about her part. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs a refugee kid who‚Äôs had Talos for a dad, you know what I mean? Maybe the fact that we didn‚Äôt know he had a kid up until this point tells you everything you need to know about their relationship.‚Äù</p><p>Emilia explained how Nick's failed attempt to help the Skrulls impacted G'iah, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot of emotions that live within her, and there‚Äôs a lot of confrontational aspects to her character that have come from circumstance. You understand why she has the feelings that she does.‚Äù</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">But was Brie Larson replaced?</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>This is NOT a news site. Look at the headline. It sounds like they recast Brie Larson. What actually happened is Emilia Clarke was cast as G‚Äôiah in Secret Invasion. A character that first appeared as a child in Captain Marvel.</p><p>Accurate name:<br>Inside the <a href=#>https://t.co/OWfe1LuiUr</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/PbecdC5MzX</a></p>‚Äî Organized Chaosüññüá∫üá¶ (@OrgChaosForever) <a href=#>April 17, 2023</a></figure><p>Secret Invasion is a six-part series that is set to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">come out in the summer</a> of 2023. But MCU fans are also hotly anticipating the sequel to Captain Marvel.</p><p>Well, good news Brie fans, because she does reprise her role in that film, which comes out in November (months after the series starring Emilia).</p><p>In other words, Emilia and Brie have their own Marvel vehicles independent of one another, and Brie has not been replaced by the Me Before You actress.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">'Captain Marvel 2' is now 'The Marvels'.</h2><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>As you can see in the trailer for The Marvels, Brie is very much still Captain Marvel. This film sees her joining forces with <a href=#>Ms. Marvel</a>, <a href=#>Iman Vellani</a>.</p><p>"Iman is the future," Larson told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">EW</a>. "She is the perfect Ms. Marvel and the most incredible person and castmate. I'm so excited for her success and I'm so excited to see what she will do with her life because she can do anything she wants. She's one of my favorite people on this earth."</p><p>Sound like someone who is bitter and has been replaced?</p><p>We don't think so either! Instead, there seems to be room for a bunch of female superheroes in the MCU, and we are rooting for all of them!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnsBuscyio6KZXZi5or7KnmSnnadisKK805qgp2Wdlr%2B3scs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. ¬© 2022.
