Whether you're trying to love who you love without prejudice or trying to live as your most authentic self, it always helps to have queer visibility in the shows and movies we watch for a sense of solidarity. Thankfully, 2021 has put forward plenty of new LGBTQ characters who help increase that visibility.</p><p>We've gotten trans characters in our cartoons, gay characters in <a href=#>Marvel</a> movies, and even some representation in Japanese animation. It's always encouraging for LGBTQ fans to see themselves represented on screen because it helps to normalize our presence in real life so we can take steps toward living in a kinder, more accepting world. With trans people having made milestones in <a href=#>entertainment</a> and different gender identities in the spotlight, LGBTQ representation is in full force.</p><p>Here are some of the LGBTQ characters introduced in 2021.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Kai Bartley ('Grey's Anatomy')</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: ABC</span></figure><p><a href=#>Non-binary</a> actor E.R.

He is tastefully depicted in a loving and healthy relationship with a man named Ben (Haaz Sleiman), and the two of them even raise a son. Phastos and Ben are also able to share an on-screen kiss.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Raine Whispers ('The Owl House')</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>ðŸ¦‰âœ¨DREAM COME TRUEâœ¨ðŸ¦‰</p><p>I guest star as Raine Whispers (pronouns: they/them), the sharp and hardworking Head Witch of the Bard Coven, in the new episode of <a href=#>#TheOwlHouse</a><br>premiering July 24 at 10:00am ET/PT on <a href=#>#DisneyChannel</a> and DisneyNOW.

One of their many crowning achievements comes in the form of Raine Whispers. As a non-binary character voiced by a non-binary actor in Avi Roque, Raine represents an encouraging step forward for positive and reaffirming representation for all ages.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Ryuji Ayukawa ('Blue Period')</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Netflix</a></figure><p>When it comes to Japanese animation, positive trans representation doesn't happen very often. But with a character like Ryuji Ayukawa from <a href=#>Blue Period</a>, that representation gets a well-deserved spotlight. While they undergo deadnaming strife at home and struggle with pursuing art as a passion, they receive support from the main protagonist Yatora Yaguchi to live honestly.</p><p>Other than that, they're never afraid to dress how they like and laugh in the face of gender expectations.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Ryan Wilder ('Batwoman')</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: The CW</span></figure><p>Despite the recast of the main protagonist, Ryan Wilder (Javicia Leslie) still continues the Scarlet Knight's characterization as a powerful DC hero who loves unconditionally.
