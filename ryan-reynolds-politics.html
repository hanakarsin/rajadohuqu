She captioned the photo, "It was Ryan‚Äôs first time. He was understandably scared. It all happened so fast. Like, REALLY fast. He wept. I pretended to weep. Then he called all his friend[s]. #voteearly." And this made some people who are unfamiliar with the Deadpool actor wonder why it would be Ryan's first time voting. Is he not from the U.S.? <a href=#>Who'd he vote for, anyway</a>?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">What we know about Ryan Reynolds' politics.</h2><p>Although Ryan Reynolds is Canadian (yup, he was born in Vancouver and became an American citizen in 2018), he seemingly leans more Democrat, based on the causes and people he supports. Back in 2019, he tweeted about his efforts made to shape climate change. "I want my daughters to experience the same natural playground I grew up in. On Oct. 21, the candidate you vote for will SHAPE CLIMATE POLICY. I‚Äôm proud of the climate progress made the last 4 years," he said, referencing the Canadian federal election. He also supported Ruth Bader Ginsberg.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I love B.C. üá®üá¶ I want my daughters to experience the same natural playground I grew up in.

"I called my senators," he tweeted, reposting a tweet calling for fair, free, and safe elections this year.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I called my senators. ‚¨áÔ∏è‚¨áÔ∏è <a href=#>#Vote</a> <a href=#>https://t.co/mFIWPDSXN5</a></p>‚Äî Ryan Reynolds (@VancityReynolds) <a href=#>June 9, 2020</a></figure><p>He (and Blake Lively) were very vocal about supporting the Black Lives Matter movement, tweeting back in late May that he donated $200,00 to the NAACP Legal Defense Fund that fights for racial justice.
