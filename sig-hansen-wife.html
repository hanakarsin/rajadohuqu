Deadliest Catch star Sig Hansen doesn't post much on his Instagram — however, his profile pic is a cute selfie with his wife, June, kissing him on the cheek. It certainly takes one hell of a strong woman to keep up with Sig. However, Deadliest Catch fans were understandably concerned about June's health due to a distressing diagnosis she received back in 2019."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

I've fished in Norway as a teenager, and I enjoyed every minute of it. We try to visit Norway once a year to see family, but we weren't able to do that with COVID-19 the last few years... It was very exciting and rewarding to go back."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">How long have Sig and June Hansen been married?</h2><p>According to another report from <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Country Living</a>, the couple have been together for a whopping 24 years and counting.
