When I read that tweet, I said to myself, ‘Me, mental health? Where is my mental health going? How did it happen?’ I told them (management) that they didn’t show me before tweeting. They said it was because they knew I would not allow them to put out the tweet. They said at that time it was the best idea to go through.</p><p>“Sometimes, I don’t forgive myself; I feel like fighting myself for that single tweet. I cannot be saying something that is not real. Anything I tweet is how I feel at that moment. I don’t think I can say I am emotional when I am not. It’s not possible.”</p><p>She also revealed that there was a time someone was trolling her and her son but when she went to the person’s page she realized that it was a faceless account.</p><p>She said, “There was this time someone bullied me and my son. I went to the person’s page and realised that the person recently opened the account. In my mind, I was like, ‘This person cannot even face me with his real account and speak to me directly. That means I am way above the person. You will never see someone who has a blue tick on Instagram bullying another person. I just gave myself courage and said, ‘This cannot be it.’</p><p>“I may be getting trolled and my assistant or sister will come to my room and see me laughing. I have fine legs and I may look at the troll’s legs and say to myself, ‘My legs are even finer and this one is talking. There is always something to massage my ego. I have never seen trolling and bullying in my life like in the past one year. The people that have been there before me, I wonder what they have been facing.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH5xe49yZqaxXaKyr8DApWShnZGhwal5wqGYpaSVo7Smec%2Boqq1lp5bAbq2MpaCeZZWteqOuzZqgo5ldnby2v8SmmK2dXamyqK2O</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
