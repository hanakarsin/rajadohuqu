The 88-year old has been acting for roughly 61 years and has been nominated for an Academy Award six times. Why is Michael Caine retiring? Here's everything we know about the actor's retirement.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">On Oct. 15, 2021, Michael Caine announced his retirement from acting on a BBC radio show.</h2><p>Per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People Magazine</a>, during an interview on the BBC Radio show Kermode and Mayo's Film Review, Michael explains that his upcoming flick Best Sellers will be his last role. "Funnily enough, it has turned out to be what is my last part, really," he explained. "Because I haven't worked for two years, and I have a spine problem, which affects my legs. So, I can't walk very well."</p><p>Michael added, "And I also wrote a book, a couple of books, which were published and were successful. So, I'm now not an actor, I'm a writer, which is lovely because as an actor, you have to get up at half-past 6 in the morning and go to the studio. As a writer, you can start writing without leaving the bed."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>The comment he made that sparked fan speculation the most was his acknowledgment that, at 88, not many people are willing to offer him leading roles. "I think [Best Sellers] would be [my last role]," Michael confirmed. "There haven't been any offers, obviously, for two years, because nobody's been making any movies I want to do. But also, I'm 88. There aren't exactly scripts pouring out with a leading man who's 88."</p><p>In the film Best Sellers, Michael plays famed cantankerous writer Harris Shaw, who reluctantly agrees to go on his first book publishing tour in decades. Best Sellers was filmed in Montreal in 2019 before the pandemic. However, new reports suggest that Best Sellers might not be the end for Michael's acting career.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Michael Caine might not be retiring after all.</h2><p>A recent report by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Wrap</a> reveals that Michael Caine's representatives have retracted his previous statement of retirement, confirming that he is "not fully" retiring. Currently, Michael has work through 2022. The first is Medieval, a Czech action film, and the second is speculation that Michael will appear in Christopher Nolan's upcoming Oppenheimer biographical film.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>In addition to his film work, Michael has written three memoirs and three informational books. His most recent memoir, Blowing the Bloody Doors Off: And Other Lessons in Life, was published by Hachette in 2018. Whether or not Michael will use his time in semi-retirement to write another is unknown, but it could be a possibility based on his positive experience playing an author in Best Sellers.</p><p>Ultimately, fans will have to wait and see whether Michael Caine decides to do more films or quietly retire with his many accomplishments.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecisZKahk52upriMnJiippViv6bAyKugp58%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
