She also landed a great gig as a sports analyst for NBC, doing daytime coverage for the 2024 Summer Olympic Games in Paris.

She competed at the 2021 Winter Cup and the 2021 U.S. Classic. But she had to withdraw from the 2021 U.S. Championships after she <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">hyperextended her knee</a> during warm-ups, resulting in a torn meniscus, a cyst, and other issues. She wasn't added to the national team and didn't qualify for the Olympics, and she ultimately retired from competition in 2021.</p><p>From the sound of it, Laurie seemed to want to explore other interests in her life outside of sports. She became more in tune with her mental health, and she began therapy to help with her depression. She also spoke out in 2020 about the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">psychological abuse she faced</a> under former coach Maggie Haney.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span><p>Laurie Hernandez and partner Charlotte Drury in 2022</p></figure><p>In 2024, Laurie talked <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Us Weekly</a> about her and her partner, trampoline gymnast Charlotte Drury, and how they've both been exploring new career paths.</p><p>"Both of us kind of eased out of sports .... We moved to New York and then got into the arts," Laurie recalled. She said it was "just nice for us to have the chance to explore what else outside of sports we might be into, and testing out all these different waters."</p><p>But might Laurie return to the sport after all? In July 2024, Laurie posted a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">video</a> of herself doing a cast to handstand on a bar, adding the caption: "Should I come out of retirement???ðŸ¤ªðŸ¤ªðŸ¤ª"</p><p>Alas, she answered her own question in the comments section, writing: "Nah I love not having morning workouts anymore Iâ€™m good."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfoa62vsieZKGdoqOur7DEs2Snp6c%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
