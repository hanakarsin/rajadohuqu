And she admittedly says she learned a lot from their relationship. So what happened? We found out all the details so that you don't have too.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Why did Chelsea Handler and Jo Koy break up?</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Chelsea and Jo Koy have known each other for years. The pair originally met on the Chelsea's late night talk show where Jo appeared multiple times on her "comics roundtable." Chelsea and Jo even joked about how they had crushes on each other on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Kelly Clarkson Show</a>.</p><p>Chelsea and Jo finally got together in the summer of 2021 and went Instagram official in September 2021 in a now deleted post.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram/@chelseahandler</span></figure><p>Sadly, Chelsea and Jo <a href=#>broke up just around their one year anniversary</a>. In a post on Chelsea's Instagram, she shares a an adorable video her and Jo preemptively recorded marking the day. In the caption, Chelsea opens up about their break up:</p><p>"We have decided together that it is best for us to take a break from our relationship right now. I know many of you were invested in our love, and I wanted to express to you how much that meant to both of us...This man blew my heart open with love and because of him, my life experience has changed forever. To be loved and adored by [Jo Koy] has been one of the greatest gifts of my life. He renewed my faith in men, in love, in being 100 percent who I am, and I’ve never been more optimistic for the future... This is not an ending. It’s another beginning, and it’s a comfort to know that I am still loved and love this man the way the sun loves the moon and the moon loves the sun."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Chelsea Handler (@chelseahandler)</a></p><span>Source: Instagram/@chelseahandler</span></figure><p>A source told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Entertainment Tonight</a> that their schedules and lack of time to see each other was the reason for the break up.</p><p>Coincidentally, Chelsea was a guest on the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">We Can Do Hard Things Podcast with Glennon Doyle</a> the day after she and Jo announced their break up. Chelsea was very honest about how she has been doing a lot of <a href=#>healing with her psychiatrist,</a> and that although she was willing to compromise, she wasn't willing to lower her standards.</p><p>Chelsea opened up and elaborated, "When you're not communicating in a loving way and that becomes a regular thing then you have to call it... You can't change somebody... intrinsically. I was willing to do so much bending but there's a line... and I didn't let myself cross that line..."</p><p>Chelsea also said, "No one cheated or anything like that. It just didn’t work out." Chelsea and Jo still have a lot of love for each other.</p><p>Thank for your openness and honesty, Chelsea. We are all rooting for you to find your person!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecOim2abmJq5tLHAZp%2BappShsrN5wKebZqKfYriwxYybqZ6Zm2LCsQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
