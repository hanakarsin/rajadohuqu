Between global pandemics and climate crises and all the bread people are baking, it's safe to say that 2020 is not going how any of us thought it would. Back in 2019, we couldn't conceive of a world in which we argued about wearing a face mask constantly and only interacted with our loved ones via a video chat app called Zoom.&nbsp;</p><p>A new meme highlights just how bonkers 2020 is by asking us to imagine explaining things from this year to people in 2019 or the distant past. It quickly proves to be an absurd idea.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Imagine showing this tweet to yourself a year ago and explaining "oh no, the masks aren't because the sky is orange, that's for a different thing." <a href=#>https://t.co/nnqoOBk3uM</a></p>â€” Meredith Haggerty (@manymanywords) <a href=#>September 9, 2020</a></figure><p>The entire West Coast of the United States in on fire, basically, but imagine trying to explain to someone last year that that is not the reason everyone is going around wearing masks. Sure, we were aware of the wild fire catastrophe last year, but the virus? Well, that's brand new!</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Imagine waking up from a coma & reading this headline. <a href=#>https://t.co/lPHvbNf41K</a></p>â€” Roxi Horror ðŸ’€ðŸŒ¸ (@roxiqt) <a href=#>May 15, 2020</a></figure><p>Not only would you be confused because you were just in a coma, but you would also think the world has gone mental. And you'd think that because it has.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Imagine showing this to someone in 2019 <a href=#>https://t.co/osQUO8G4t8</a></p>â€” Ramp Capital (@RampCapitalLLC) <a href=#>June 23, 2020</a></figure><p>In 2019, it would have been thought of as absurd for an opera house to open with a performance to thousands of plants and thousands of plants alone. In 2020, we call that a Monday.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Imagine going back in time one year and showing people this picture of a stadium full of cardboard fans and a sky of orange. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/8SU5qhfAxf</a></p>â€” Mike Elgan (@MikeElgan) <a href=#>September 11, 2020</a></figure><p>The cardboard cutout thing is truly one of the most bizarre developments to come out of the pandemic. I don't understand the appeal. To me, it's a creepy trek into the uncanny valley from which we'll never be able to return fully. And the orange sky is just an apocalyptic cherry on top of this disaster sundae.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Imagine trying to explain to a time traveler from the 90â€™s what is happening in this picture <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/rWL0Yxtjee</a></p>â€” influencersinthewild (@influencersitw) <a href=#>August 4, 2020</a></figure><p>What? It's just a woman wearing a face mask taking a photo of an ice cream cone with her phone to post to the internet, which is also on her phone, so she can get likes and feel temporarily better about herself before she continues to doom scroll and lose all hope for humanity. I don't see what's so hard to understand.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>imagine explaining this tweet to someone from last year <a href=#>https://t.co/GISIV1yGPx</a></p>â€” Fred Delicious (@Fred_Delicious) <a href=#>April 25, 2020</a></figure><p>Did I imagine that one day Tom Hanks would save us all? Sure. Did I think it would happen so soon? Definitely not.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>imagine explaining this tweet to someone 6 months ago. <a href=#>https://t.co/RInpu1DTw8</a></p>â€” Zach Cramer (@zacramer) <a href=#>May 16, 2020</a></figure><p>In 2020, it was surprisingly not weird to see a priest with a water gun, trying to squirt people driving by with holy water.
