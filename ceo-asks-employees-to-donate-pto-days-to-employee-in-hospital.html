As you can imagine this has been quite a drain on her family's income. If there is anyone who would like to donate one or more days of their PTO please let [redacted] VP of Financial Services, know in writing of your intent.

There is no US law about PTO unless you are in California or part of a union, and those are to protect the employees, employers can give anything they want to anyone. What a tasteless letter"</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Reddit | @blink_bridgette</span></figure><p>Also, presumably as the President & CEO of the company, they are probably earning more than their employees and could donate a portion of their salary for the year in order to make sure that their employee is taken care of, especially considering how many years of their life they dedicated to the company.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Reddit | @blink_bridgette</span></figure><p>There are a growing number of people on social media expressing their displeasure with the way business is being conducted in America. It's no secret that there are a large number of corporate lobbies that greatly influence national policy in our country, meaning that there are a number of our elected officials who swore to protect the interests of the people who are, in fact, corporate shills.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Reddit | @blink_bridgette</span></figure><p>While a number of massive corporations have been bailed out by the American people's coffers while we argue and lobby for rights like Universal Healthcare and minimum wage increases to keep up with the rate of inflation, big businesses like <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Goldman Sachs</a> can suck at their jobs so badly that they'll go bankrupt, but can later rely on our money to get out of trouble.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Reddit | @blink_bridgette</span></figure><p>At least Goldman was able to pay what it borrowed back, but then there are <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Airlines who tanked their own businesses</a> from stock buyback programs after the COVID-19 pandemic happened. They relied on our tax dollars to stay afloat, only to turn around and lay-off tons of employees, and time will tell if they'll ever get that money back into the federal reserve.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Reddit | @blink_bridgette</span></figure><p>What do you think? Is it "normal" for a boss to ask their employees to donate their own paid time off in order to help out a co-worker? Or do you believe that the onus falls on the shoulders of the business and that they shouldn't be asking other employees to essentially foot the bill of their rehabilitation?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmLKwecCsoqxllaK9rbvYnpysZaSkeqW7zZqrnmWgqbxusMCyqmasn2KyrrzLqLCenV2eu260zqynoqyRoQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
