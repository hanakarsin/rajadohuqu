She turned to a French sect of the religion to ordain her as a priest — although the title wasn't recognized by the traditional establishment, since women aren't allowed to be priests.</p><p>After being ordained, Sinéad defended ripping up the photo of the pope and also apologized for it, telling <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The New York Times</a>, "I’m not sorry I did it. It was brilliant. But it was very traumatizing. It was open season on treating me like a crazy b---h.”</p><p>But she also said about the incident, "I'm sorry I did that, it was a disrespectful thing to do. I have never even met the Pope. I am sure he is a lovely man. It was more an expression of frustration."</p><p>Although she also told the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">BBC</a> that Jesus appeared to her in a vision as a child, and said, "I love Jesus," the late star converted — or as she put it, "reverted" — to the Islam faith before her death, and therefore, died as a Muslim.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Sinéad O'Connor changed her name after converting to Islam.</h2><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dHMjyi gzSWnW"></figure><p>In 2018, years after telling the world to "fight the real enemy" on national TV, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sinéad converted to Islam</a>, explaining at the time on social media that the process was "the natural conclusion of any intelligent theologian's journey."</p><p>She added in the now-deleted post, "All scripture study leads to Islam. Which makes all other scriptures redundant."</p><p>The singer, who previously released an album entitled "Theology," also changed her name to Shuhada Sadaqat.</p><p>Religion was clearly a huge part of Sinéad's life. She invoked God when announcing the tragic passing of her 17-year-old son Shane in 2022.</p><p>"My beautiful son, Nevi'im Nesta Ali Shane O'Connor, the very light of my life, decided to end his earthly struggle today and is now with God," the heartbroken mother tweeted in a now-deleted post, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>. "May he rest in peace and may no one follow his example. My baby. I love you so much.
