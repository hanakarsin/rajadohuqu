Unfortunately, that was the closest the bride ever got to the cake of her dreams.</p><p>As she looked on in confusion, restaurant staff cut and served her wedding cake to another party, with Celeste saying to her husband, "That looks a lot like our wedding cake."</p><p>Indeed as she would soon find out, it was, and instead of savoring a traditional <a href=#>wedding moment</a>, the bride says what was likely a prom party got to sink their teeth into the custom confection.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@celeste0203 href=#>@celeste0203</a><p>They served our wedding cake to another partyðŸ˜¡ðŸ¥ºðŸ˜­<a title=cake href=#>#cake</a> <a title=cakeart href=#>#cakeart</a> <a title=weddingfail href=#>#weddingfail</a> <a title=weddingtiktok href=#>#weddingtiktok</a> <a title=weddingday href=#>#weddingday</a> <a title=weddingcake href=#>#weddingcake</a></p><a title="â™¬ original sound - Celeste Geren" href=#>â™¬ original sound - Celeste Geren</a></figure><p>Upon posting her TikTok, the tale of a wedding cake that wasn't got so much attention, Celeste was compelled to make it clear that Washington state-based Cake Walk Shop was not at fault in the mix up. The <a href=#>bakery</a> simply made the dessert gone wrong.</p><p>First, commenters â€” and, well, anyone who is reading this â€” is wondering how the heck this could have taken place at all. And did the restaurant make good on the wedding day disaster?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">So, how did this wedding cake mix up even happen?</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@celeste0203 href=#>@celeste0203</a><p>Should I drop the name of the restaurant or nah? <a title=wedding href=#>#wedding</a> <a title=weddingdrama href=#>#weddingdrama</a> <a title=weddingcake href=#>#weddingcake</a> <a title=weddingtiktok href=#>#weddingtiktok</a> <a title=weddingfail href=#>#weddingfail</a> <a title=weddingday href=#>#weddingday</a> @Celeste Geren</p><a title="â™¬ original sound - Celeste Geren" href=#>â™¬ original sound - Celeste Geren</a></figure><p>Celeste revealed in a follow-up video that the mix up happened when she and her <a href=#>groom</a> snuck outside during their wedding reception to enjoy a private moment on a dock.</p><p>"While we were having that moment, that's when my mother-in-law came out and told us what had happened," she explained in the clip.</p><p>At that point, the waitress brought out a cake that said "Jackie" on it. "They could not find our cake," Celeste added, and that's when she realized she'd witnessed another party enjoying the cake that looked like hers earlier.</p><p>"It was not her fault," the <a href=#>newlywed</a> insisted about the server who had burst into tears. "It was a very devastating moment."</p><p>Soon, commenters were imploring Celeste to share where the devastation had happened. After resisting for a while, the recent bride took to TikTok one final time and simply said she would "stay away from any Italian restaurants that start with the letter 'L'" in the Everett, Wash. area.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@celeste0203 href=#>@celeste0203</a><p>Replying to @josh I hope this helps! <a title=wedding href=#>#wedding</a><a title=beweddingrama href=#>#beweddingrama</a> <a title=weddingcake href=#>#weddingcake</a> <a title=weddingtiktok href=#>#weddingtiktok</a> <a title=weddingfail href=#>#weddingfail</a> <a title=weddingday href=#>#weddingday</a> @Celeste Geren</p><a title="â™¬ original sound - Celeste Geren" href=#>â™¬ original sound - Celeste Geren</a></figure><p>In the comments, she later admitted, "Damn thereâ€™s a lot of Italian places that start with 'L.'" Celeste also implored people not to send hate mail to these establishments.</p><p>With many commenters swearing that the restaurant should have taken money off of their bill, Celeste admitted that she had not reached out to the manager, but that they were not there the night the cake debacle played out.</p><p>"That manager should have been calling you, not the reverse!" one person stated, echoing the sentiments of many.</p><p>And while many commenters insisted that the mistake had cost the bride a memory she'll never get back â€” as well as likely hundreds of dollars â€” others praised Celeste for her cool, calm demeanor under the circumstances.</p><p>Ultimately, perhaps one commenter said it best by urging the bride to just laugh it off and think of the cake mistake as a <a href=#>funny wedding day story</a> to tell for years to come.</p><p>What's your take?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfp7K0wMCuqZqmpGLEprDDoqWgZZOWuKZ51qump59dpa6zwNg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
