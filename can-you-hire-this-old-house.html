After all, the legendary PBS show has 45 seasons, so they must know a thing or two about home improvement.</p><p>For fans who are looking to try something fresh, it turns out that there's a way to get the talented team to come to your home. However, it isn't guaranteed that your house will be chosen.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: This Old House Facebook</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Can you hire 'This Old House'?</h2><p>It isn't as easy as just shelling out some money, but you can <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">apply</a> to be a part of the show. The producers go through the applications to find homes that are the right fit for the show. There isn't one certain type of home that they're looking for either.</p><p>"From downtown lofts, to ornate country Victorians, to bungalows in the suburbs, the series is accepting proposals for all housing types, styles and neighborhoods," the show advertises.</p><p>Thankfully, the show's geographic guidelines aren't too strict either. According to the site, they try to make sure at least one project per season is located in New England which isn't too much of a shock since that's where the show started.</p><p>Otherwise, they're just mindful of climate when selecting their homes. "We prefer projects located in climates where outdoor work may be undertaken during the winter months, and often we choose the geographic location first and then consider proposals in that area," they explain.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by This Old House (@thisoldhouse)</a></p></figure><p>Keep in mind that while you aren't "hiring" the team in the same way, you are still paying. They warn that you would be responsible for covering the costs of the project, but they'll help with discounts if they are possible.</p><p>Don't wait to apply, either. If you're looking to start renovations in 2024 and complete them by 2025, then now is the time to apply since they're looking to get these projects featured on the show for next season.</p><p>As a reminder, they add: "Please note that due to the volume of proposals received, This Old House will not be able to respond personally to everyone. We try to respond to those whose projects are of interest within three weeks of submission."</p><p>When applying, you'll be asked to provide basic information about the home, including the style, the year it was built, and some context about the project itself.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by This Old House (@thisoldhouse)</a></p></figure><p>Be prepared to share your budget and a pretty detailed description of what you're looking to do to your home. Plus, they'll want to know a bit about you and your family too.</p><p>Since this is all for television, they request some photos and videos, including of the house and the homeowners. It's OK if you already have a team for the project, as long as you're able to include information about the architect and who you're working with.</p><p>This Old House is a PBS show that's now also available to watch on the Roku Channel.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmK6vediorGagmaeybsDHoqpmp5yZeqm71Kyc</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
