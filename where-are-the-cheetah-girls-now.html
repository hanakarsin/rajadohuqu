The iconic Cheetah Girls once claimed they would remain both sisters and friends for life, but in the years since the 2003 film premiered, we can't help but wonder if the iconic foursome even stays in touch anymore.

Long before she won multiple Grammys for her iconic album A Seat at the Table, Solange auditioned for The Cheetah Girls, and, according to <a href=#>Adrienne Bailon-Houghton</a>, she could’ve played Aquanette “Aqua” Walker.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Adrienne told the podcast’s hosts she thought Solange would be “perfect” for the role since the character was from Texas, just like the Houston native.</p><p>“She has the Texas accent, the hot sauce," Adrienne explained. "It was supposed to be Solange.”</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Solange didn’t accept the role, and it ultimately went to <a href=#>Kiely Williams</a>, who played Aqua during the trilogy. As for why Solange turned the role down, Adrienne said she didn’t know the specifics and claimed Solange dropped out “at the last minute, for whatever reason, ended up not doing the film."</p><p>Although many of us would’ve loved seeing Solange represent her home state in the Disney film, some fans can’t imagine The Cheetah Girls without the ones who ultimately accepted their roles. Let’s continue seeing where all of the ladies are now!</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Raven Symone (who played Galleria) is back on Disney.</h2><p>After several glorious years on Disney Channel, Raven went on to host The View in 2015. She also made appearances in State of Georgia, A Girl Like Grace, and Black-ish before eventually starring in and executive-producing <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a That's So Raven spinoff</a> called Raven's Home. The series shows the beloved psychic living life as a 30-something adult with special powers.</p><p>Raven has also become somewhat of an LGBTQ+ icon. The Disney star spoke to Variety about <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">hoping to inspire more young people</a> to come out as gay, and not to be ashamed of their sexuality. This was shortly after she opened up to her co-stars on The View about being a lesbian. Since coming out, <a href=#>Raven married Miranda Maday</a> in a private ceremony in June 2020.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Adrienne Bailon (who played Chanel) is thriving.</h2><p>The 4-foot-11 singer underwent <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a major lifestyle change in recent years</a>, according to BET. In summer 2019, she decided to set some attainable goals, create weight loss deadlines for herself, cut down on drinking alcohol, increase her water intake, and finally, she went vegan. Other than running a blog to influence others in the realm of wellness, she was one of four co-hosts on The Real, which won her multiple Daytime Emmy Awards before the show ended in May 2022. She also competed on <a href=#>The Masked Singer as the flamingo</a>.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Adrienne and Raven apparently reunited</a> at the 2020 Los Angeles Women's March, where together, they performed the classic Cheetah Girls track "Together We Can." Obviously, I was inspired and crying the entire time.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Kiely Williams (who played Aqua) is now focused on family.</h2><p>After living the Disney dream, Kiely went on to pursue a solo singing career, but other than a debut solo single, "Spectacular," which came out in 2010, nothing huge came out of it. However, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she continued acting</a>, appearing in a few movies, from Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2 to House Bunny and Stomp the Yard 2.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Kiely tied the knot with Brandon, aka "BJ" Cox, in December 2019 in Fort Worth, Texas. They have two daughters together —Rowan and Archer. These days, she's more focused on starting her family than pursuing her singing career.</p><p>Kiely and her Cheetah Girls co-star Sabrina Bryan seemed to have stayed in touch — together, they co-starred in a few web series together called "Dinner With Friends," and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sabrina served as a bridesmaid in Kiely’s wedding</a>. Aw!</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Sabrina Bryan (who played Dorinda) is a happy mama.</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sabrina continued acting as well</a>, landing roles in Help Me, Help You, Fish Hooks, I Think My Babysitter's an Alien, and A Deadly Dance. She also competed on Season 5 and 15 of Dancing With The Stars, and released a workout DVD in 2005.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>, Sabrina married her husband, Jordan Lundberg, in 2017. Since then, she has become a mother of two children. In 2020, Sabrina gave birth to her first child, Monroe, during the height of the Covid-19 pandemic. Three years later, she and her hubby welcomed their son Ledger into the world in May 2023.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>While a Cheetah Girls reunion would be absolutely epic, it seems like our favorite ladies are busy doing their own things.
