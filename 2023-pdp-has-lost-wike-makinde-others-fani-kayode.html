It’s what you call poppycock. And these are the words of a drowning party spoken by a drowning man with a drowning candidate.</p><p>“There is nothing like that. We are above board, we are serious about what we are trying to do, we are going to achieve our objective, we are going to win this election fair and square. And they are the ones that have lost five governors.</p><p>They’re the ones that can’t get their party leaders to come to their rallies at their presidential inauguration. We don’t have that challenge. We are working slowly but surely. As one together, everybody’s coming together. And I’m very proud to be part of this.”</p><h2>Campaign List Controversy</h2><p>Fani-Kayode asserted that the controversy surrounding the All Progressives Congress (APC) campaign list has been addressed at the meeting and the inauguration of the members will be done soon.</p><p>The APC chieftain said all party stakeholders will be speaking in one voice, adding they are all&nbsp;working towards an objective, which is to launch the campaign as soon as possible.</p><p>According to him, “This meeting we just had has more or less clarified everything, that is why the Publicity Secretary of the party, is here; that is why all the four media directorates in the PCC were represented. Everybody was there, the governors, the PCC.</p><p>“We are all speaking as one; we all&nbsp; agree on everything. We’re working towards an objective, which is to launch as soon as possible and not to come out strongly and there’s really no hurry about this as far as we are concerned.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH5xe5BsZmtoYmh6sbDPZp%2Baq12hvLTAjLCgpJ1doq6stc2dnGanpJ2ys7%2BMn5inoV2grrq7w55m</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
