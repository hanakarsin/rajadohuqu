Where does Ed Sheeran live? Currently, the multi-gifted musician resides in Framlingham, Suffolk, United Kingdom, where he grew up. He is the owner of a property, Wynneys Hall, which local residents <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">fondly call Sheeran-Ville</a>. Ed Sheeran's house is a large modern farmhouse that he bought at the cost of £895,000 in June 2012. His compound also has other properties that he acquired over time. His house is located very close to his parent's house.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/842dc14a13d457e6.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Aston Merrygold biography: age, height, parents, net worth, partner</span></p></a><p class=align-left>After purchasing the farmhouse, he also bought the adjacent home for £450,000. He later purchased the four-bedroom home in front of his main house for a sum of £925,000. Additionally, he purchased the small bungalow next to his expanding property for a total of £525,000. He has since made adjustments to these properties to meet his taste and style. Today, the property has a large and <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">gorgeous tree-house</a> with amazing views, an indoor swimming pool, a garden pod, decking and a hot tub. He also has an underground music room and cinema that connect to the main house via a 6-foot-wide underground tunnel. The tunnel ensures that people do not access his main house during functions such as parties.</p><p class=align-left>He also converted a barn in his property into a pub. Despite all his wealth, his neighbours report that the singer is still a humble and down-to-earth person. Residents spot him at the local bar now and then. Ed intends to start and raise his family in the property.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/e998221da693c103.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Pauline Chalamet bio: age, height, brother, boyfriend, net worth</span></p></a><p class=align-left>In addition to his massive residence, Ed has invested about £42 million in the property market.

Two of the apartments are located near Shoreditch, six are in Hammersmith, three in Holland Park, one in Notting Hill and two in Chiswick. He also owns a restaurant in Notting Hill.</p><h2>What else has he bought?</h2><p class=align-left>Ed is not a fan of buying things to keep up with his peers. After making millions of dollars, he bought his first car in 2015. Unlike what many people expected, his first car purchase was a mini cooper! At the time, he could not even drive properly! When questioned about the bizarre purchase for a 'rich man,' he asserted that he did not have a liking for fast vehicles. He went on to explain that despite buying himself a mini cooper, he had bought his sound guy a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Porsche for Christmas</a>.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/5dc72a74facd569f.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Interesting details about Katey Sagal: Age, career. love life, net worth and more</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/e4c9cc00ae18a2c0.jpg><p class=align-left>Over time, the musician, songwriter and record producer upgraded his car after making more millions from his career.

He got three points on his driving licence and a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">£100 fine.</a> This happened days after he was criticised for encouraging speed in the line 'driving at 90' in his <i>Castle on the Hill</i> song. In March 2017, he reported that <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">he rarely drove </a>his sports car because he looked like a 'tit' in it.</p><p class=align-left>The musician has also made some of his spending habits public. Soon after his breakthrough, he treated himself by buying himself the Star Wars Death Star Lego Kit. In 2016, Ed went on a shopping spree at Toys R Us. He picked out a pirate ship, a Nerf gun, wheelie shoes, and other things at a total cost of £2,000. He reported that he has plenty of kids' stuff. He has a room filled with teddy bears, and his bedroom has two large pandas.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/7fd3a913ca2c856a.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who is Rebecca Romijn BTS?
