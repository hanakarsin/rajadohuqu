Ask a die-hard fan and they will likely tell you that it's Prince Herb, the comedian formerly known as Sal Vulcano. If watching his sister, Jenna, marry James Murray, or jumping out of a helicopter after losing yet another challenge wasn't enough, he now had to change his name and pierce his ears as well."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

So, what's going on? Will Prince Herb remain Prince Herb forever?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Prince Herb changed his name after losing a dare in a recent episode of 'Impractical Jokers.'</h2><p>In a recent episode of <a href=#>Impractical Jokers</a>, the foursome tried to con others as "past life therapists," psychics able to decipher what a person was in their past life. In essence, they all had to convince the blissfully uninitiated person sitting in front of them that he or she once was "a professor," "archeologist," or the like. But how did <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Prince Herb</a> become Prince Herb?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Those following the show will be familiar with Prince Herb's at-best <a href=#>mediocre track record</a> in acing challenges. He was dealt another crushing defeat in a recent episode of Impractical Jokers.</p><p>As a punishment, he had to change his name on every social media platform. What's more, he now performs his stand-up comedy sets as Prince Herb. To add insult to the injury, his co-stars also coerced him into piercing his ear. On the flip side, he also has a new beverage, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Prince Herb Brew</a>.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><p>As Prince Herb revealed on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Kelly Clarkson Show</a>, he will keep the name until the end of the season.</p><p>"I lost on the show, and I got punished, and this is my new identity now," Prince Herb said. "It's a whole thing. They made me pierce my ears and wear diamond studs. They are changing my name in the credits, the intros, all my press, print, everything in my life. When I do standup comedy, I get called to the stage as Prince Herb now. And I have to do this until the end of this season. It's terrible."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">'Impractical Jokers' was renewed for Season 10 in February 2021.</h2><p>The cast and creators of Impractical Jokers scored a significant victory in the first half of 2021. Just hours ahead of the Season 9 premiere on Feb. 4, 2021, TruTV announced its decision to renew the show for another season.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><p>Over the past seasons, the lives of the cast members have changed considerably. Take <a href=#>Joe Gatto</a>, who married Bessy in 2013, or Murr, who tied the knot with Melyssa Davies in 2020. It's understood that he ditched Prince Herb's sister shortly after the impromptu wedding ceremony.</p><p>The secretive one of the group, Brian "Q" Quinn prefers to keep his personal life tightly under wraps. Many believe that he is flying solo at present.
