Now, he heads the whole Whitman Team, the top-producing team at Triplemint who makes buying, selling and renting homes across New York positive and exciting experiences.</p><p>And although he's now incredibly successful and boasts a chic Midtown Manhattan apartment complete with an in-unit washer-dryer and a coveted walk-in closet, he's gotten that all by working his way up from the bottom. After graduating from University of Alabama Birmingham, the Southern belle packed his bags for NYC without a job or a plan.</p><p>"He made ends meet by selling Broadway musical tickets during the day and working at Planet Hollywood in the evenings," reads a Triplemint blog <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">post</a> about the star.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">He underwent a radical transformation.</h2><p>Move over, <a href=#>My 600 Lb Life success stories</a>, because Tyler dropped more than 200 lbs... <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">by eating Chipotle.</a></p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>#transformationtuesday is my favorite holiday.

Tyler used to weigh 400 pounds and decided one fine day to turn his life around. "Now I'm going to f-----g take over," he says in a clip. His weight-loss journey and how it's positively affected both his outlook on life and his career (and wallet) will be a storyline of Tyler's during Million Dollar Listing New York.</p><p>He revealed to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">New York Post </a>that Chipotle plays a big part in his weight maintenance... And now we're officially hungry.&nbsp;</p><p>After he got <a href=#>gastric sleeve surgery</a> in 2015 once he decided he was officially "so tired of being the fat guy," Tyler fell in love with Chipotle and now eats at the chain twice a day every day.&nbsp;</p><p>Chipotle "feels like a treat to me, and it's still fully in line with my health goals," he said, following up on Instagram that he wouldn't mind to be sponsored or affiliated with the fast-casual Mexican franchise.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Follow Tyler on Instagram... he's hilarious!&nbsp;</h2><p>This queen is hilarious and we immediately smashed the follow on his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram page</a>.</p><p>Considering he's super charming, funny, and knows what it's like to work super hard to achieve both career and health goals, he's kind of our favorite agent these days. Fredrik and Ryan are going to have to step up their game to compete with Tyler.</p><p>Don't miss Million Dollar Listing New York, Thursdays at 9 p.m. on Bravo.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqcatsdFmrqGhpKKur3nMoqOloZ%2BjeqW7y6WYq2WcnsC1tc2g</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
