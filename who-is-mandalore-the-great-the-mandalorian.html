Welcome to Mandalore, where the air won't kill you but the hungry Alamites will! Din Djarin (Pedro Pascal) finally achieves his redemption mission (well, sort of) to bathe in the mines of Mandalore, but his journey comes at great cost, multiple saves from Bo-Katan (Katee Sackhoff), and several lessons in Mandalorian lore."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Season 3, Episode 2 of 'The Mandalorian' introduced viewers to more Mandalorian history.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Disney Plus</span></figure><p><strong>Spoiler alert: This article contains spoilers for Season 3, Episode 2 of </strong><a href=#><strong>The Mandalorian</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p>Welcome to Mandalore, where the air won't kill you but the hungry Alamites will! Din Djarin (<a href=#>Pedro Pascal</a>) finally achieves his redemption mission (well, sort of) to bathe in the mines of Mandalore, but his journey comes at great cost, multiple saves from <a href=#>Bo-Katan</a> (Katee Sackhoff), and several lessons in Mandalorian lore.</p><p>Thanks to Bo-Katan, Din survives to find the Mines of Mandalore, which in Bo-Katan's eyes are nothing more than a smokescreen. She reads the plaque by the Mines of Mandalore like a jaded tour guide, clearly not buying into the legend of Mandalore the Great mentioned on the plaque.</p><p>So, who is Mandalore the Great? Were they like the King Arthur of the Mandalorians? Here's what we know.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Disney Plus</span><p>Spoiler alert - it's not Grogu. (Or is it?)</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who is Mandalore the Great in 'The Mandalorian'?</h2><p>Mandalore the Great did actually exist once upon a time, in a galaxy far, far away.</p><p>Bo-Katan mentions Mandalore the Great during her snarky tour of the Mines of Mandalore. She explains to Din, via the plaque, that Mandalore the Great was said to have tamed the mythical Mythosaur, which supposedly dwells in the Mines of Mandalore. (Bo-Katan's skepticism quickly goes straight out the window when she spots an actual Mythosaur in the depths of the Mines of Mandalore while saving Din, again.)</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Wookiepedia</a>, Mandalore the Great once led his people in many fights against the Jedi, long before the Galactic Empire wiped the Jedi out with <a href=#>Order 66</a>.</p><p>After Mandalore the Great tamed the mighty Mythosaur, the beast became the symbol of the Mandalorian people. So in a way, Mandalore the Great is like the Mandalorian King Arthur. Bo-Katan scoffs at the legend — until she spots an actual Mythosaur in the murky depths of the Mines.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Disney Plus</span><p>That's no moon, it's a Mythosaur!</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Wait, was the Mythosaur alive?</h2><p>Din might not have convinced Bo-Katan that his redemption ritual was warranted, but the Mythosaur certainly made a believer out of her. And the Mythosaur definitely seemed a bit miffed that two Mandalorians interrupted his watery nap.</p><p>So, what does the appearance of the Mythosaur mean for The Mandalorian Season 3 going forward?</p><p>As the Armorer (<a href=#>Emily Swallow</a>) once said, the songs of the past essentially heralded the return of the Mythosaur with the second rise of a new Mandalorian era. Now that Bo-Katan has seen the Mythosaur and wielded the Darksaber, could this be foreshadowing a new age for the Mandalorian people?</p><p>Not so fast — Bo-Katan technically needs to win the <a href=#>Darksaber</a> back from Din in order to be the weapon's rightful wielder.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>Armed with knowledge of the Mythosaur, Bo-Katan could use that to her strategic advantage to become the new Mandalore the Great.</p><p>Or will she choose to work with Din in order to usher in a new era for their people? We'll just have to wait and see when The Mandalorian Season 3, Episode 3 premieres on Wednesday, March 15, 2023 on Disney Plus.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWwecisZKaZnpmurbvRnmStoJVitLOxwK1kraCVYrqiusOao6iqmZa7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
