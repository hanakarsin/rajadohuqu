Yusuf Datti Ahmed, has disclosed that if elected into office, he and his principal, <a href=# rel=noopener>Peter Obi</a>, will fish out those terrorising the country wherever they are.</h2><p>Datti said on Monday that the <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Labour Party</strong></a> presidential candidate would swing into action from the first month in office.</p><p>He said the Obi-Datti administration would ensure it stops the incessant killing, kidnapping and stealing of the nation’s resources in the first month of government and begin a healing process for the country.</p><p><strong>Naija News</strong> reports that Datti stated this during a one-on-one programme on Channels Television today.</p><p>The former lawmaker said kidnapping for ransom, subsidy racketeering, and money laundering, among others, would be tackled, and the economy would be boosted via investment in agriculture, infrastructure and attraction of foreign direct investments.</p><p>Asked what the Obi-Datti presidency would do in four years, Datti said: “Before you get to four years, in the first month, stop the killing and start the healing; stop the stealing and start the keeping; stop the slide and start the climb.</p><p>“And in four years, you will see huge farmlands in the North; expansive roads going all over; industries in Kano and Kaduna; huge manufacturing outfits; refineries all over Southern Nigeria; more bridges across the Niger; universities won’t be on strike for four years; a stable naira; and armed robbery will be a thing of the past. A community being attacked at night will be history. Kidnap on federal network, make a phone call on our GSM, no. We will fish you out wherever you are. Nigerian armed forces will serve justice on you.”</p><h2>Nigeria Will Witness Fast Recovery</h2><p>Datti stressed that the Labour Party administration, if given the opportunity, will not rest until corruption and highly placed individuals who stole from the nation are brought to book.</p><p>“Racketeering in subsidy, I don’t think so. Foreign exchange scam, definitely not. Gatekeepers around the villa, money launderers around the villa, peddlers of influence around the villa, I assure you none. We won’t have hangers-on that don’t have jobs, like it happened in the past; no way, it won’t happen,”&nbsp;he said.</p><p>According to him, “Nigeria will witness very fast recovery,; meeting our OPEC quota (in oil production); Nigeria will start to export; Nigerians happily will be attending Nigerian universities and attending Nigerian hospitals,going on holiday in Obudu, Cross River, Yankari, Jos all over in the same way that you have elites with their money going out for holidays. We will do our holidays here in Nigeria.</p><p>“Nigerians in the Diaspora will be coming back to Nigeria with their expertise, and knowledge. We will bring all those hot heads back, and make the naira stable.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH5ye5FxZmtoYmh6uLGMsKClpF2btrS0jLKmrmWfqsFuvMStnKtln5e2tHnVqWSdmaSptm6tx6acnWWknb%2BmrdOepaxlm56xr63PqZyrq12hvLDAxKuqaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
