Blake chose to leave home to evade a life of crime and avoid following in his father’s footsteps. Nevertheless, it appeared that he would be the heir to the ranch, and John Wayne wasn’t happy about it.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>In a previous interview, Kyle Schmid opened up about his character and how John Wayne really felt about his brother, Blake. He shared, “He believes he is very deserving of the ranch, and as Blake has taken off, he feels that it is owed to him, that he should get everything. But Blake returns, it's dangerous because it threatens what he believes should be his, and you see this whirlwind of a demise."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>For showrunners, Blake’s death was premeditated and intentional. Executive producer Ross Fineman said that viewers should expect to see even more plot twists in upcoming episodes.&nbsp;</p><p>In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Ross explained, "The end of the pilot was so shocking but what has been extraordinary is that every episode is shocking. Every episode has moments where when you're reading the script you go, 'You're kidding me! Where are they going to go from here? How is that possible?' And it just keeps going and going."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Although viewers may have been forced to say goodbye to Blake, we may get to see him in upcoming episodes by way of flashbacks. While the Kleinsassers were able to cover up Blake’s murder, recent episodes prove that John Wayne may have bigger problems.&nbsp;</p><p>His sister, Cheyenne (played by <a href=#>Britt Robertson</a>), saw the entire thing go down and used the information she had about her brother’s murder to get in her father’s good graces.&nbsp;</p><p>You can watch new episodes of Big Sky Tuesdays at 10 p.m. EST on ABC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWwecqio6WdlGKvra3KnmSkpJWeu7St0qycq2Wfo3qjtcZmqqSx</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
