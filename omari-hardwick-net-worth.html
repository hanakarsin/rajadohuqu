However, we have consistently heard stories from actors, especially Black actors, who have felt they weren't appropriately compensated until later in their careers. And Omari Hardwick is another example.</p><p>In a May 27, 2022, episode of The Pivot podcast, Omari got candid with hosts Fred Taylor, Ryan Clark, and Channing Crowder about his finances throughout his career. And while Omari finally admitted his Power salary, he does say that “he never made what he should have made” from acting.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>“The money … I never made what I should have made,” Omari told the hosts. “It’s happening now, finally.”</p><p>Omari also went on to share that 50 Cent has the utmost respect for him since the actor paid the rapper back with interest.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>“I think he forever just really, really respects the s--t out of me for that,” Omari told the hosts. “We’re just not taught that in our community. For me to give it back to 50 with interest, I was just so proud to be able to do that, and it was early. He felt like, ‘Damn O, you can’t be messed up. You need money. It was the summer after Season 1 [of Power] and then it was the summer after Season 2. He gave me $20,000 and then the next summer he gave me $23,000. It was absolutely given to me in a way of ‘take care of your family.’”</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>After the hosts threw out their guesses about Omari’s salary on Power — with Fred guessing $150,000 an episode — the 48-year-old revealed that Fred was correct.</p><p>"You got it right," Omari told Fred. "This is the first time I’ve ever disclosed it. But, I was also the face of the network."</p><p>Thankfully, Omari now feels that he is getting paid what he deserves for his talent. Although Power is officially behind Omari, fans are ready to embrace his new projects.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfpLqivshmn5qqlKy2pLeMp5ytZaekv7W0</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
