It is clear that it was set up simply as a drain pipe.</p><p>“The Nigerian youths are appalled that while they languish in unemployment and abject poverty, a few individuals are living large with our common patrimony.</p><p>“Mr President, during his visit to Imo State on Monday re-echoed his determination to fight corruption. He identified this as one of the major reasons he removed fuel subsidy.</p><p>“While we hail his promise, we believe that he should convince Nigerians that there are no sacred cows by outrightly sacking the Humanitarian Affairs Minister, Beta Edu and the Interior Minister, Olubunmi Tunji-Ojo.</p><p>“Even though Tunji-Ojo is one of the best hands in this administration with the reformations he has carried out in the passport process, we cannot but say that the payment of millions of Naira to a company he has interest in is a great dent to his reputation.</p><p>“We, therefore, urge President Bola Ahmed Tinubu to wield the big stick by sacking the two ministers.</p><p>“This will send a clear signal to other of his aides and head of government agencies and MDAs.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpkZH1ye5BwZqyZk6C2r7OMm5ytmV2asbZ5066lo6FdpLewedaio6Vlo5q7pXnCpZyaql2otqi6wKVkraddpMGpsdGsZKigkaOupsbEZrCoraSdwG7AxKWjrGWknru2rtRo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
