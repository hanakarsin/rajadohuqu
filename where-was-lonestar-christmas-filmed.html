Source: LifetimeWhen Lifetime’s Lonestar Christmas was filmed, producers took into consideration the need for a Christmas movie setting that looked as much like Texas and a Texas ranch as possible. The result is a ton of different sets with twinkling lights and Texas flags that definitely look like they could be in the real-life lone star state, but are they?"><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Along the way, she falls in love, because why wouldn't she? And, of course, she learns a little something about the magic of Christmas. But, as with most Lifetime and Hallmark holiday movies, viewers have questions about the specifics of actually filming it.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Lifetime</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Where was 'Lonestar Christmas' filmed?</h2><p>Lonestar Christmas takes place in Texas. But, according to IMDb, it was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>filmed in Vancouver</u></a>, British Columbia, Canada. It’s not uncommon for Hallmark or Lifetime holiday romance movies to be filmed in Canada, even if the production companies are based in the United States. The movies also prove that it’s entirely possible to transform almost any location into a small snowy town for the sake of TV movie magic.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">The actress who plays Erin is no stranger to TV movies.</h2><p>Stephanie Bennett, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>who plays Erin</u></a> in Lonestar Christmas, might look familiar as Lydia from Shadowhunters. The Canadian-born actress has also been in her share of TV movies over the years, so she is plenty experienced in the world of TV rom-coms. She was in Lifetime’s The Christmas Pact in 2018 and Valentine in the Vineyard and The Last Bridesmaid on Hallmark.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by STEPHANIE BENNETT (@stephaniedbennett)</a></p></figure><p>And there are few genres she isn't willing to try.</p><p>"I thought after doing UnReal that I wanted to do mostly comedy, because it was so much fun, but now I’m really loving doing drama," she said in a 2015 interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Talk Nerdy With Us</u></a>. "Then I got to do fantasy, so honestly, I can’t choose. I loved getting to do this amazing fantasy role as well as this gritty real role at the same time. I love doing all different kinds of genres."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">There are other movies in the 'It's a Wonderful Lifetime' lineup that were filmed in the same country.</h2><p>It’s not clear exactly why so many TV movies and even some TV shows that are popular in the U.S. film in Canada, but it could have something to do with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>tax credits</u></a> production companies receive for filming in the northern country.
