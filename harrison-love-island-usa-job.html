Sadly, his time was cut short when he was eliminated from the villa on day 15.</p><p>The six-foot-four stud joined the beach with another familiar face from Season 5: <a href=#>Kassy Castillo</a>.</p><p>Based on what happened during Harrison’s time on Season 5, viewers can expect a few shakeups and some heads to turn. Fans may have some questions about this new bombshell, especially about what his job is. Here's what we know about Harrison's work outside the villa.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@harrisonluna</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Harrison Luna's job is essentially to be a “gold guy.”</h2><p>As far as jobs go, Harrison has struck gold — literally. His job is to trade gold and diamonds as a diamond dealer. On his Instagram page, his profile is set to “finance” and he lists his interests as “gold, golf, diamonds, and fitness.”</p><p>Given his good looks, it makes sense that he has also worked as a model. Odd jobs in the hospitality industry have also been his forte.</p><p>When he spoke to Jasmine Sklavanitis in Season 5, he explained that he was once a diamond in the rough who was forced to work some odd jobs. This includes topless waiting and chauffeuring.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Love Island USA (@loveislandusa)</a></p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram | @loveislandusa</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">What happened when Harrison Luna was on’ Love Island’ Season 5?</h2><p>Harrison is a familiar face to avid Love Island watchers. When he was on the show during Season 5, he coupled up with Destiny Davis. However, his head later turned toward Emily Chavez. Both were eliminated from the villa on day 15 from a twist that had the islanders choose which couple they wanted to eliminate.</p><p>With the control out of fans' hands, some were annoyed and accused the producers of rigging the voting.</p><p>Harrison spoke out about his sudden elimination, telling <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">PopCulture</a>, “Maybe I feel like the way that Leo went about his move around from Kassy to Anna, then Anna to Kassy… I don’t know, that rubbed me up the wrong way, and he was the first to say that he went about it wrong,” he said.</p><p>“But I would think that that sort of to and fro is not, I guess not conducive to Love Island and heading in the direction of something serious with that person…” he added.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by 𝐻𝒶𝓇𝓇𝒾𝓈𝑜𝓃 𝐻𝒶𝓃𝓈 𝐿𝓊𝓃𝒶 (@harrisonluna)</a></p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram | @harrisonluna</a></figure><p>Ultimately, his sole connection to Emily may have played a role in his elimination. “Unfortunately, I just didn’t have a close enough connection with the other girls in the villa, so I was on the chopping block,” he justified.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfna6zvsispqdlnKTDpnnIrKOappRiwrStjKOmmw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
