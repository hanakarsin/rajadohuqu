Source: InstagramIf there's something awfully familiar about science teacher Dr. Katman on The Goldbergs, then it's likely you actually saw the actor who plays Dr. Katman in an'80s movie or two. In fact, tonight's episode, &#34;Cocoon&#34; is a tribute to one of his movies."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

In fact, tonight's episode, "Cocoon" is a tribute to one of his movies.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who is the science teacher on 'The Goldbergs'?</h2><p>Dr. Katman is played by the one and only Steve Guttenberg, who had a really big career in the '80s (he's been in films and TV shows since, but the '80s is when he truly shined).&nbsp;</p><p>Steve played Carey Mahoney in the Police Academy movies, Jack Bonner in Cocoon, Michael in Three Men and a Baby, Roger Callaway in It Takes Two, and others. The Goldbergs' creator, Adam Goldberg, chose Steve because he reminded him of his own chemistry teacher he had in high school, and knew the actor would be perfect.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Also, talking of being transported back to my youth, I've just come across (ahem) this photo of Steve Guttenberg from the movie 'Cocoon'. One of my first crushes. Can't think why... <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/7rfJ4CHZYA</a></p>‚Äî Tom üßëüèº‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßëüèªüå≠üê∂ (@Tom_TheSequel) <a href=#>March 10, 2019</a></figure><p>Adam explained, "Steve is a truly gifted actor with real dramatic chops and impeccable comedic timing, which is why I was so thrilled he <a href=# rel=nofollow>agreed to be on The Goldbergs</a>. As a plus, he‚Äôs an absolute joy to work with and one of the friendliest mensches in the business. The role that he plays on the show is a perfect fit for him, and as you‚Äôll see, he is an utter delight to watch.‚Äù</p><p>And Steve equally admires Adam, saying, "A career is chock-full of good moments, and they are the ones that the audience remembers. Adam is one of the greatest audiences ever. He appreciates a great story, a great production, and stuff that works. He‚Äôs an admirer of comedy, so I think that‚Äôs just a part of a normal conversation with me and with other filmmakers‚Äîto talk about the stuff you‚Äôve done."&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>As for Steve's personal life, he got married to model Denise Bixler in 1988, but the two got divorced in 1992. In 2016, he and his girlfriend, WCBS-TV reporter Emily Smith, announced they were engaged ‚Äî &nbsp;the couple got married in 2019. Both Emily and Steve post plenty of cute couples photos on Instagram.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Emily Smith (@emilysmithtv)</a></p></figure><p>Steve is also involved in philanthropic projects, specifically charities that aim to help solve the homelessness problem in Los Angeles, and provide extra attention to homeless youth. According to <a href=# rel=nofollow>Look to the Stars</a>, a database focused on charitable celebs, Steve started his own charity called Guttenhouse, and he also runs Sight for Students, which helps provide glasses for young people in need.</p><p>If you want to know more about the actor, you're in luck: Steve published a memoir titled <a href=# rel=nofollow>The Guttenberg Bible: A Memoir</a>, which goes into his experiences in Hollywood. The book description reads "In this honest, charming memoir, Guttenberg tells the unique story of his first decade in Hollywood, as he went from being a complete unknown to starring in some of the most successful blockbusters of all time."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Amazon</span></figure><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Steve's IMDb</a>, you can expect in several new titles, like Roe vs. Wade (he plays Justice Powell), which comes out this year.&nbsp;</p><p>Keep up with The Goldbergs every Wednesday on ABC at 8 p.m. EST.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWwecisZK2glWLApLXEp5qeZaSarqS0xKtkqKZdqbWmecaoo52alae0tA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. ¬© 2022.
