These days, however, working in news media entails far more than simply reporting the news. It seems as though most networks are becoming more politically biased as time goes on, and it’s very rare for a news show to report the news without leaning one way or the other in their commentary.</p><p>In July 2024, Savannah attended the <a href=#>Republican National Convention</a> (RNC), giving viewers a glimpse inside former <a href=#>President Donald Trump</a>'s VIP box, where he mingles with friends and family. She also shared the view from the RNC floor, sparking curiosity about whether Savannah supports the political party or is simply excited by the event. Some commenters on her videos suggested her past criticisms of Trump might indicate her political stance. Here’s what we know about her political affiliation.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">What are Savannah Guthrie’s political views?</h2><p>Ideally, journalists should be able to keep their own political opinions at arm’s length in order to report the news without relying on their own personal biases. That’s pretty difficult to do these days, though, as networks tend to favor analysis over straight-up reportage of the facts.</p><p>That being said, it seems as though Guthrie works hard to keep her own political opinions from influencing the way she reports the news. She has conducted several highly regarded interviews with members of both major political parties without tipping her hand and revealing how she personally felt about her subjects. As such, she has also endured criticism from people on both sides of the aisle regarding some of her work.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Savannah Guthrie (@savannahguthrie)</a></p></figure><p>Guthrie reported exclusive details about Osama bin Laden’s death, interviewed Donald Trump about his involvement in the unfounded and racist “birther” conspiracy, and was the first person to announce <a href=#>Matt Lauer</a> would no longer be her cohost when he was fired from the Today show. In her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter bio</a>, Guthrie refers to herself as an “Equal opportunity interrupter of non-answerers,” implying that no matter where someone falls on the political spectrum, she has no interest in pulling any punches.</p><p>It’s worth noting that in 2014, Guthrie married former Democratic political adviser <a href=#>Michael Feldman</a>. He served in Bill Clinton’s 1992 presidential campaign and went on to become former Vice President Al Gore’s deputy director of legislative affairs and, eventually, his chief of staff. In other words, it’s safe to say that Guthrie’s husband is a Democrat. That may indicate that Guthrie is as well, but spouses are (obviously) not required to hold the same political opinions just because they’re married.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Savannah Guthrie (@savannahguthrie)</a></p></figure><p>Though Savannah generally keeps her political views private, she faced criticism for moderating a Trump town hall on NBC in 2020. Her July Instagram posts, offering behind-the-scenes access to the 2024 RNC in Milwaukee, also drew comments questioning her motives, with some accusing her of disliking Trump but attending to collect a check. Despite this, Guthrie deserves credit for maintaining professionalism and not letting her personal opinions affect her reporting.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqK63rc2nmKFll6rBqb7InmSpp5yewaqvwKVkr6GVrMA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
