Throughout his career, <a href=#>Luke James</a> has steadily proven that he is ready to join the ranks of <a href=#>Jamie Foxx</a>, <a href=#>Beyoncé</a>, <a href=#>Jennifer Lopez</a>, and all of the versatile talent who can excel in multiple domains.</p><p>I first heard of Luke in college, around 2014 or 2015. His voice mesmerized me, and one of his songs, “I.O.U.,” had me in a chokehold for an entire semester.</p><p>Soon after falling in love with his pipes (and seemingly perfectly good looks), I and the rest of the world discovered the talented actor within him.<strong> </strong>Over a short period, Luke has made a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">successful transition into acting</a>. In May 2024, he had social media on fire after performing in Prime Video’s horror series Them. The New Orleans native also has a starring role on Showtime/Paramount Plus’s <a href=#>The Chi</a> as Victor “Trig” Taylor.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>There are numerous intriguing aspects of Luke James’s character in The Chi, from his role as a caretaker for his younger brother, Jake (Michael Epps), to his transformation from a thug to a politician. However, it's his relationships with two openly transgender women on the show, played by trans actors — Jasmine Davis and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">L’lerret Jazelle</a> — that seem to be the focus of The Chi's avid viewers.</p><p>In a May 2024 interview with The Breakfast Club, the actor — who welcomed a baby with a woman named <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sunny Lewis</a> in 2023 — defended the criticisms he receives for playing a man attracted to trans women, a testament to his commitment to his role and the show.</p><p>Sadly, Luke’s treatment from critics of his character being attracted to trans women isn’t much of a surprise. To some, his character is worse than the real-life actions of artists who have managed to be “separated” from their art.</p><p>Let’s get into this <a href=#>Sound Off</a>.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Luke James has been subject to homophobic and transphobic online comments since joining ‘The Chi.’</h2><p>In Season 5 of The Chi, Luke’s co-star Jasmine announced she decided to leave her role as Imani. L’Terrett joined the series the following season as Victor’s <a href=#>new girlfriend, Fatima.</a></p><p>As their relationship progressed, Luke, the actor, continued receiving hateful comments on social media, with many jumping quickly to homophobia and transphobia by calling him gay.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Luke James is gay for his role<br>In the Chi 🤷🏾‍♂️</p>— BurleyBoy2️⃣2️⃣3️⃣ (@JReese_88) <a href=#>May 7, 2024</a></figure><p>Throughout his time on The Chi, Luke has defended Victor’s romantic relationships in multiple interviews, telling AP Entertainment that the criticisms he receives “don’t move me,” no matter how many times his haters try.</p><p>He also proved himself to be the artist critics say they want, stating that his ability to “ruffle your feathers” is necessary while creating art that will “reflect the times.”</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>"My artistry will ruffle your feathers."</p><p>"The Chi" star Luke James shares how he responds to negative criticism toward his multifaceted character and his love interests. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/PGYlCKeXQf</a></p>— AP Entertainment (@APEntertainment) <a href=#>May 9, 2024</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">“Separate the art from the artists,” right?</h2><p>Contrary to one homophobic belief, if a man or woman is attracted to transgender people — also known as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">skoliosexuality</a>, per WebMD — it doesn’t mean they define themselves as gay or even a member of the LGBTQIA community.</p><p>As trans people, <a href=#>activists</a>, and allies have been trying to drill in mindless heads, TRANS WOMEN ARE WOMEN, AND TRANS MEN ARE MEN. So, if we want to talk gender, there’s nothing “gay” about a straight man shooting his shot, as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cosmopolitan</a> explained in a 2015 feature on skoliosexual men.</p><p>“Finding transgender people attractive is the most natural thing in the world,” one heterosexual man shared. “They are beautiful."</p><p>\Within the Black community, real-life couple and social media sensations Charles and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mrs. Netta</a> show that neither The Chi nor Luke is (hopefully) trans-baiting by his character. As Luke mentioned on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Breakfast Club</a>, his job was to bring “truth” to his character, including a relationship he said he’s “kindred to.”</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@vn1tyxaffair href=#>@vn1tyxaffair</a><p>During an interview with the Breakfast Club, Luke James spoke about his role as Trig on the Chi, where his character has a transgender love interest. In case you are new to the show, Imani, who was James' first love interest, was originally played by Jasmine Davis. During her time on the show, she held it down bringing visibility to the lives and love stories of transgender women. Unfortunately, Imani did not return after season 4. However, love didn't stop living in the Chi, and the show introduced us to another transgender woman named Fatima, played by L’lerrét Jazelle. Okay, so here's the thing. Charlemagne is known for asking questions about transwomen, and he has had a lot of experience being dragged in this area. However, despite this, he still sometimes does things that are questionable. For example, when he interviewed Luke, he chose to ask about his transgender love interest rather than his portrayal as a thug. The assumption that it's natural for a man to be violent but not to love a transwoman reinforces societal beliefs. This way of thinking also suggests that any love for a transwoman must be rooted in sexual desires, the desire to maintain one's masculinity under DL Supremacy, and we find ourselves again asking who keeps booking The Breakfast Club for these interviews when they cannot do them properly. Season 6 Part Two returns May 12th on Paramount+ <a title=thechi href=#>#thechi</a> <a title=lukejames href=#>#lukejames</a> <a title=jasminedavis href=#>#jasminedavis</a> <a title=llerrétjazelle href=#>#llerrétjazelle</a> <a title=leanawaithe href=#>#leanawaithe</a> <a title=tonibryce href=#>#tonibryce</a> <a title=monroeelise href=#>#monroeelise</a> <a title=audaciousconcern href=#>#audaciousconcern</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - vanityXaffair" href=#>♬ original sound - vanityXaffair</a></figure><p>Luke further said showing his character “be a loving person” with his partner shouldn’t have been as taboo as fans made it. <a href=#>Charlamagne</a> then questioned him about how he’s “protecting his peace” as he continues facing backlash for his role as Victor. The actor again focused on the art, stating nothing else bothered him.</p><p>Luke’s approach to the chatter concerning his role is honorable and the perfect example of what it means to be unbothered. However, few could blame him for not sharing his frustration with those who, in this case, can’t separate the art from the artist.</p><p>Surprisingly (or unsurprisingly), Luke and his supporters’ belief that he is a brilliant actor first is in the minority. Many of his naysayers choose to go the latter, the more childish route of jumping to his sexuality.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span><p>R. Kelly and Bill Cosby</p></figure><p>However, it’s safe to say these people on social media are the same ones screaming for Apple to bring back the <a href=#>discography</a> of <a href=#>R. Kelly</a> — a convicted sex abuser and pedophile currently serving 20 years in prison. Because, to many, no matter how much time has passed since that legendary Boondocks episode, stepping in the name of love is separate from decades of predatory behavior.</p><p>And, while we’re here, let’s also remember that folks were furious when <a href=#>The Cosby Show</a>’s reruns halted amid <a href=#>Bill Cosby</a>’s 2015 rape allegations, in which he was convicted of three felony counts of sexual assault. Like R. Kelly, Bill served three years in prison before being released in 2021. Still, even through his convictions, someone on some corner of the internet is still debating if we can separate “America’s Dad” from the man we now know.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I think GenX was so used to trauma being normalized by being paraded in front of our faces daily that we never developed the muscle needed to call stuff out. Think Bill Cosby, Diddy, R Kelly, Seinfeld, Woody Allen, and so many others - we saw it.<br>(Btw: Shoshanna Lonstein-Gruss… <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/DsJcNz4a17</a></p>— Black Mommy Activist, PhD🎙 (@kayewhitehead) <a href=#>May 4, 2024</a></figure><p>If some of you can even consider forgiving known predators, I would love to think you can show the same grace to an actor showing a version of love that is real, valid, and just as beautiful as anyone else’s. Alas, this is ’Merica, where transphobia and homophobia can openly rear its ugly heads on any given basis.</p><p>Fortunately, Luke is planning on more seasons of The Chi and a lifetime of being way too easy on the eyes.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqLy2usNmpp%2BeXaHCrLGMo5imnaNiwamxjJyfomWkp66vv8%2BhppuhkWKwsLnMnqWtqw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
