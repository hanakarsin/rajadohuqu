The actress and the agent shared mutual friends, and Tyler decided to contact the Pacifier star on Instagram.</p><p>Before they started dating, the now-spouses actually had crushes on each other.</p><p>"We had a bunch of friends in common, and he actually reached out to me on Instagram with a really lame pickup line," Brittany told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a> in 2020 about how her relationship with the agent began.</p><p>The couple went to a Mexican restaurant for their first date, and they were inseparable shortly thereafter.</p><p>"We got tacos after years of being infatuated with one another and forgot how to speak entirely. There was a certain amount of tequila consumed, and then we just started talking a lot," Tyler told People. "Then we fell in love and nothing's really changed, we're still eating tacos and margaritas together."</p><p>The couple took the next step in their relationship in early 2019.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Tyler Stanaland (@tylerstanaland)</a></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">The couple got engaged in 2019, and they wed in 2020.</h2><p>After their successful taco date proved to be the start of a committed relationship, Tyler and Brittany announced their engagement in February of 2019.</p><p>The private pair confirmed that Tyler had actually proposed "a few weeks" earlier in their kitchen, and that they wanted to keep the news to themselves (and to their family and close friends) before sharing it with the public.</p><p>Brittany and Tyler wed in Malibu in March of 2020, shortly before the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions began in the United States. Though it rained on their wedding day, nothing could dampen the bride or the groom's spirits.</p><p>The duo even served tacos and tequila at their wedding, which was done in homage to their first date.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Tyler and Brittany "support" each other "endlessly" in their respective career ventures.</h2><p>In the years since Brittany and Tyler tied the knot, they've both been busy in their respective careers.

Though Brittany isn't physically appearing on the Netflix reality series, Tyler told Distractify that the two have vowed to always root for each other when it comes to work projects.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>"When we first got together, we just made a choice that, whatever is best for each of our career[s], we would support [it] endlessly," Tyler shared with Distractify. "So it's nice to have her support now. And I support her when she does her thing, so it's good."</p><p>Brittany has led a life in the spotlight for more than two decades, and Tyler describes himself as a more "reserved" person. Has the screen star been able to give her agent husband any advice to prepare for his impending reality TV stardom?</p><p>"Everybody has their advice within the space, but it's tough to kind of give advice, because this is a different thing than what she does," Tyler said about taking on reality TV. "She plays characters, [and] this is kind of real life. People will form different opinions, and react differently. So, although she has shared some advice, it's kind of tough to gear up for until it actually happens."</p><p>You can catch Tyler on the debut season of Selling the OC, which will be available to stream on Netflix beginning on Aug. 24 at 3 a.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqcatsdFmqq2Znpa5orrDZpmroaSprq%2FFjKylqK9dp7KtrdOipqermJ69bsDIppyloZ6a</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
