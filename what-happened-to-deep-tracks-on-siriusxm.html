The Gist: 
SiriusXM appears to have quietly retired Deep Tracks, one of its stations, and many users are upset about the change. Deep Tracks played classic rock songs that were never released as singles and were only available on albums.The retirement of the channel could be part of broader cost-cutting efforts as SiriusXM deals with the emergence of streaming music."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Typically, that means they were songs off of albums that were never released as singles.

The station has become an internet-only station, Channel 308, a fate that has also befallen other channels over the years, and means that older cars can't access it. Unfortunately, SiriusXM hasn't offered much in the way of explanation for its decision, but it seems likely that the channel was quietly retired in large part because it didn't have enough listeners to justify its continued existence on satellite radio.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Now, many fans of the channel are rallying in an attempt to return it to the airwaves.</p><p>"I love Deep Tracks. Too much great music to lose. While 60s Gold, 70s on 7 and The Bridge repeat the same old hits day after day, Deep Tracks presents great stuff that I never heard over the airwaves. I hope it doesn’t leave Sirius," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">one person wrote</a> on a message board following the news that the station had left.</p><p>"It's one of my [go-to] stations. I'm curious what will be taking it's place on that channel. I would very much like it to stay put. Where do I sign?" another wrote, referring to the petition to bring the channel back.</p><p>SiriusXM has brought channels back in the past due to popular demand, but it's undoubtedly going to be an uphill battle for fans of the channel hoping to see it restored to its rightful place.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr><a href=#>@SIRIUSXM</a> decision to move <a href=#>#DeepTracks</a> to ch. 308 is odd. It was fine where it was. But to move it to a channel where 'older' cars cannot access it - and with the channel's general demographic probably having lots of those 'older' cars - it just doesn't make a lot of sense.</p>— Platform & Stream (@PlatformStream) <a href=#>November 8, 2023</a> <span>Source: Twitter/@PlatformStream</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Satellite radio is not what it once was.</h2><p>SiriusXM is likely long past the peak of its popularity. Thanks to the advent of streaming music, many people have left their SiriusXM subscriptions behind, which may mean that Deep Tracks is not the last channel to go as they continue to cut costs.</p><p>Even as fans battle to keep the stations they love on the air, SiriusXM is trying to find a way forward that allows it to stay in business. While they haven't said this yet, it seems possible that many more stations could become available only on the Internet in the years ahead.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyhmKmolaOypXnTqGSdnZWlerW%2BwJyirGWfo3q0tdGirKywnQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
