We are taking every step to make sure that the challenges are resolved,” he said.</p><p>Addressing the chairmen during the meeting, Wike expressed his displeasure at their constant travelling outside their areas of responsibility.&nbsp;The Minister stressed that the government can no longer fold its hands when residents are going through such challenging times.</p><p>Wike said, “This time around we will not be happy, where Area Council Chairmen will leave their responsibilities and travel out. We have gotten reports that Council Chairmen travel anytime and then, if anything happens, they will not call anybody’s name except the FCT Minister.</p><p>“Recently, NUT embarked on strike and it is not our fault but the Area Councils’. Primary schools are under the body of the Area Councils but again, it will look as if the Ministers are doing nothing but that is not our responsibility. However, we can’t fold our hands and we have invited them to this meeting to see how we can resolve the problem.</p><p>“So council chairmen should know that they must live up to their responsibilities. It is not everything that happens, they would say that it is the Ministers that have not taken steps.”</p><p>The Minister said he, the Chairmen of the six area councils, and the security agencies would work together to ensure peace returns and residents can sleep in peace.</p><p>“So, we will put our heads together to come up with solutions; we are not sleeping, the security agencies are not sleeping, we will provide every support that they require to allay the fears of the residents,” he said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpkZH1ye5BvZrChm5p6tMHMpqanq12auqa%2Bxp6lnLFdqLKkwdGiq7JlnZqytbXNoGSorpWneqq60p6arqqZqcZutc1mmJutmpZ8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
