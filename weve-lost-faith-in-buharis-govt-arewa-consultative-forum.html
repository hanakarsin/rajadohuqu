The whole place is in chaos, they are killing people every day. That one is not publicised because there is no oil in Taraba.</p><p>“All over the north, there is insecurity. I have never felt unsafe like I feel now. What can I say? You have seen what is happening to our people,” he said.</p><p>“How can I have faith in someone who presides over this kind of thing? I had faith in him when I followed him as a reporter and he chased away some foreigners who were coming to kill us,” he said.</p><p>“When he was coming to be President, I had faith in him. I witnessed how successful this man was in chasing enemies out of our country in 1983.
