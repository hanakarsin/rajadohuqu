Paupers don’t contest elections. How much more a senatorial election?</p><p>“He must be a man of some means. In fact, before then, he had been contributing to political organisations and causes before he took up the gauntlet and went into the senate.&nbsp;He was not a pauper.”</p><p>“What I know is that right from his days in the corporate world, he has been trading in stocks even in foreign currencies,”</p><p>“He has been buying stocks, bonds and all of that. I’m not a finance person. I’m not going to be interested in the nitty-gritty of it all.</p><p>“But I know he has been trading in stocks. He was buying stocks of blue chip companies and all of that. He was making money and spending money. He has been doing all of these years before he got to office.</p><p>“Why people are querying his source of wealth is because he had been a successful governor of Lagos and a successful politician even after office.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH16e5BrZmtoYmh6pbHLnmSapJGgsm6%2BxK%2BcmqSjYsGqutSbrKxlo6TCs6%2FEZqafZaearq3Ax2g%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
