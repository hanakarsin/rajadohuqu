Here’s what you need to know about the guy who describes himself as “relatable, motivated, and brown.”&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Sorry, ladies. Big Brother contestant Ovi Kabir has a girlfriend.</h2><p>If you stalk Ovi’s Instagram (which we obviously did), you’ll see a ton of pictures dedicated to his girlfriend <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Hannah Blackwell.</u></a> The BB contestant and the Sephora beauty adviser have been dating for nearly two years, celebrating their anniversary in December. &nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>“This year was not full of just fun times but we had good days, challenging days, & better days, but that’s how I think it should be. This year went by slow but it gave me the chance to enjoy every moment & I wouldn’t have wanted it any other way,” he captioned an Instagram picture of the two. Seriously, they’re too cute!&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Ovi is obsessed with his dog … and we don’t blame him.&nbsp;</h2><p>The former college student admitted on his CBS profile that the most difficult part about living in the BB house is being “away from my dog.” He added: “My mom and girlfriend can live without me for a while, but my dog is a little dumb and I worry that something is going to happen to him while I'm gone …It really comes down to me missing my dog.”</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>The adorable corgi Mowgli is just 13 months old and is a total <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Instagram model</u></a>. With his own social media profile, this pup has almost 4,000 followers. Whether he is posing alongside mom and dad or enjoying a nice belly rub, Mowgli is already an Insta-famous dog. &nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Congrats! Ovi recently graduated from college.</h2><p>Besides making it into the Season 21 BB house, Ovi also has another reason to celebrate. The 22-year-old recently received his college diploma. In May, Ovi shared on Instagram that he graduated from the University of Tennessee with a BA in political science.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>While we guess many of his friends will be working or traveling this summer post-college, the reality star has other plans. “A lot of people have asked what my plans are for the summer, and while at first it consisted largely of playing Fortnite, I am excited to announce today that I will be a cast member of Big Brother Season 21,” he posted. Well, we definitely can’t wait to watch how this Croc-lover fairs in the competition.&nbsp;</p><p>Catch new episodes of Big Brother on Tuesdays at 8 p.m. ET on CBS.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfpMOqecGinmaaoqTBqbHRZp6iqpybv6qxzZ0%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
