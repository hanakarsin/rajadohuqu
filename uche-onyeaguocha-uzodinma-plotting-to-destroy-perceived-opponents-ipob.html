We have our legal team and Uche Onyeagocha is not one of them. IPOB has also not appointed him as our Secretary as we do not have any such position in our leadership Structure. Besides, appointing a non member of IPOB into its leadership smacks of stupidity.</p><p>“Biafrans and the world at large must come to terms with the fact that the impostor in IKONSO HOUSE masquerading as governor is nothing but a well known fraudster.</p><p>“This fraudster forged a purported cancellation of the Sit-At-Home call by IPOB against the visit of the arch genocidist Muhamadu Buhari to Imo State.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH5xe5BpZq6bmJp6sLrYnpigrZ%2BYtaJ51LOmnaGeoq5uvMuoq62hnpx6tbuMnZysrKKkxm68xKuanqGmmrFuu8%2BppqednqnAbrXPqJlo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
