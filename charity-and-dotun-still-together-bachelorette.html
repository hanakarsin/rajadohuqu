But luckily, Charity and Dotun’s fairytale romance is the real deal. Not only did they reveal during ATFR that they’re already planning the wedding (although they’re not in a rush), but Charity even called Dotun her “future baby daddy.” Okay, girl, that is promising!</p><p>Every season, the hosts of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Good Morning America</a> interview the season’s lead and new partner, and Charity’s season is no different. Entertainment correspondent Kelly Carter sat down with Charity and Dotun, who were holding hands and showing their love through the camera. “It couldn’t have went [sic] down better,” Dotun said.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Charity and Dotun ♡ (@charityanddotun)</a></p></figure><p>The proposal showed how truly in love the couple is. Dotun began, “You made me feel adored and validated and wanted. And to receive that from a woman of your caliber, Charity.” But Charity one-upped him: “I saw a man that respected me, that valued me, that adored me, but a man that I could love forever. You made me feel so valued and so seen.”</p><p>When discussing the magical proposal, Charity revealed, “Imma be very honest. I did black out a little bit. His intentionality with how he speaks—every single word, it has so much weight and meaning.” Dotun later added, “I’ll never be able to express how grateful I am for the forces at be that brought us together. I did not want to do it, but something just kept telling me to do it. My heart’s going to burst open thinking about it.”</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Okay, enough already! We get it—they are majorly in love. In fact, Dotun even shared a pic of them to his Instagram story and wrote, “And that’s a wrap. Thank you all so much and what an amazing life-changing journey (clearly). Love you baby.”</p><p>Not only are Charity and Dotun still together, but they’re eager to go on their next big adventure together—<a href=#>Dancing with the Stars</a>! Charity will compete in the new season as Dotun supports her every step of the way. If that’s not a dream engagement, we don’t know what is!</p><p>Congratulations to the happy couple—we can’t wait to see what your future holds! Perhaps another <a href=#>Bachelor Nation baby</a>?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmLWivsitsGaZnpl6pbvTrqVmq6Seua1506ienqyYmr9ursCcn56kn6eytcDE</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
