Now, major changes at the company have led two instructors to say goodbye — first Ross Rayburn, and now <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kendall Toole</a>.</p><p>On June 13, 2024, Kendall announced her departure from Peloton in an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram reel</a>. She said that she had decided to “close [her] chapter at Peloton,” and naturally, fans and subscribers are wondering what she’s going to do instead. So why did Kendall Toole leave Peloton?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Kendall Toole decided to leave Peloton to pursue other opportunities as a fitness influencer.</h2><p>While we don’t know the full extent of why exactly Kendall decided to leave Peloton, we know that she’ll definitely be fine when it comes to her career. She has worked with Peloton since 2019 with her first class available on Sept. 10, 2019. Since then, she has garnered almost 1 million followers, a Lululemon partnership, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">new representation with WME Agency</a>, which was announced in March 2024.</p><p>Meanwhile, Peloton has been going through its own changes. In early May 2024, Barry McCarthy stepped down as CEO and the company announced that almost 400 employees would be laid off. They also shared that they would reduce the amount of live member classes in London, proving that they’re downsizing and restructuring.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Kendall Toole (@kendalltoole)</a></p></figure><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Redditors suggested</a> that because Kendall started with Peloton in 2019, her 5-year contract would be up for renewal and that it’s likely she rejected whatever the new contract was. It does seem like it was Kendall’s decision to leave and not Peloton’s, but it’s possible that it was a somewhat mutual decision based on whatever they offered her in a new contract.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Some have speculated that Kendall could working on a television show or podcast.</h2><p>About two weeks before Kendall announced her departure, she shared some Instagram stories with home decor television personality Galey Alix with the captions, “Easter egg!” and “Easter egg number 2!” Kendall was also in Florida a month earlier, potentially looking at homes, so <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">followers have speculated</a> that she’s working with Galey on some sort of home buying and design series for a new Florida home.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Dan Churchill M.S.
