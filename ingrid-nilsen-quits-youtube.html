"This is marking over 10 years of making hundreds of videos on YouTube and growing up on this platform and on the internet. This moment is something Iâ€™ve always known would happen. I just didnâ€™t know when it would happen, and I definitely didnâ€™t imagine it happening in the current world circumstances."</p><p>Ingrid explained that despite starting her channel when she was only 20, she always had this "instinct" that YouTube would be a temporary part of her career, and that some time in her 30s she would have to leave the platform behind.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>My new fave sweatshirt makes her debut in my new unedited tutorial where I have a mild meltdown over applying cream blush ðŸ¤“ðŸ˜… link in bio!</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>Ingrid Nilsen</a> (@ingridnilsen) on Feb 14, 2020 at 11:59am PST</p></figure><p>"It is time for me to end this chapter and that instinct that I have had inside of me, where I always knew in my 30s I wouldnâ€™t be making YouTube videos anymore, I wouldnâ€™t be a professional influencer anymore, that was real," she said. "This seed was planted years ago, and it didnâ€™t become clear until the last few months that the time was approaching and that it would in fact be this year. It happened right on time."</p><p>After telling her life story, explaining her sometimes fraught relationship with her mother, who is Thai, losing her dad while she was really young, and coming out as queer on a public platform, she thanked her viewers for being there while she grew up on her channel.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>"In this moment, by ending this chapter, I have loved so much, as hard as it has been, as grueling as it has been at times, I have loved growing up with you," she said through tears.

We did this, and we did it together."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">What's Ingrid doing next?</h2><p>Ingrid explained that while her sudden leave will be hard for everyone, she felt there was no way to "transition" from being a professional influencer to her next chapter while still creating content as a professional influencer. But as to what she's doing next, Ingrid admits that she's not so sure.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-fyFmx rJYJh"></figure><p>"I donâ€™t have a plan. I donâ€™t," she said. "I know thatâ€™s the thing youâ€™re supposed to have, but I donâ€™t. All I know is that I need to stop because that is what my deeper self is telling me to do and I need to take a break for the summer. I have not given myself a break in over a decade."</p><p>She says she plans to give herself a couple of months before she begins to figure out what's next, but she knows it won't include being a professional influencer.</p><p>Ingrid said her Instagram and other social media channels will still be active, but she won't continue to use them as her main source of income, instead making them a space for her to share what she wants.</p><p>"I want to be able to show up on social media and not have it be my job because I actually donâ€™t know what thatâ€™s really like," she explained.</p><p>Ingrid also clarified that her newsletter will still be going out, though the schedule will be on her own terms, giving her better flexibility with it.</p><p>While Ingrid may be leaving her platform, she will continue to share her life with her followers in a much less professional sense.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnruovsidZKehnKiyr3nQrqCtq12uvLbA1Juc</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
