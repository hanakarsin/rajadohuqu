We got it for you," the leader of the pack calls out, as other employees gather behind in the sweet and very honest story.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: TikTok/@messyymadie</a></figure><p>As more workers get pulled into the video, the employee who is creating the story says, "PSA: If you love your friend, please tell her that you left your phone at Whataburger."</p><p>"We got you!" the orange shirt and visor clad employee adds. "We love you. Please come back."</p><p>The roughly 30-second video has been shared many thousands of times, and garnered over 1,130 comments at time of writing.
