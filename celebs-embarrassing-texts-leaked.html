From phone hacks exposing embarrassing revelations to secretly recorded conversations being leaked to the press, if you're a celeb, you should probably think twice before sending eggplant emojis to fans. Like these celebs, you might find yourself in a whole lot of trouble.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">1. Jeff Bezos</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>You probably heard about Jeff Bezos' recent divorce from his wife of more than 20 years. Unfortunately, it wasn't because of the ol' "irreconcilable differences." Instead, it was revealed that Jeff had a mistress on the side, TV host Lauren Sanchez. If that wasn't already bad, the National Enquirer leaked <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">private text messages</a> Jeff had sent to Lauren. Gems such as "I want to tuck you in slowly" and "I want to breathe you in" made the Amazon CEO the laughing stock of the Internet. And in case you were wondering how The National Enquirer got a hold of the texts, a source revealed that a close friend might have leaked it.</p><p>"In my experience, a lot of times it's a friend of the mistress who&nbsp;perhaps isn't the closest friend," the source <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a>. "People talk. He's the world's richest man. That's hard to keep quiet."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">2. Prince Charles</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Before smartphones, couples had to have steamy conversations the old-fashioned way: via landline phones. Back in the '90s, one of the biggest scandals to rock the British royal family was when Prince Charles was caught having an affair with Camilla Parker Bowles. In a leaked phone conversation between the two, everyone learned that the prince had some <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">strange kinks:</a></p>Charles: "Oh god. I'll just live inside your trousers or something. It would be much easier!" Camilla: (Laughs.) "What are you going to turn into, a pair of &nbsp;knickers?" (Both laugh). "Oh, you're going to come back as a pair of &nbsp;knickers." Charles: "Or, God forbid, a Tampax. Just my luck!" (Laughs.) Camilla: "You are a complete idiot!" (Laughs.) "Oh, what a wonderful idea!"<p>Can you imagine if something like this leaked out of the palace today? The Internet would implode.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">3. Tiger Woods</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Tiger Woods' private life outside of golf has been a hot mess. After his highly publicized divorce from ex-wife Elin Nordegren, a string of mistresses came forward to reveal they all had relationships with the golfer. "I will wear you out," he <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">infamously wrote</a> to waitress Jaimee Grubbs. "I need that so bad," he <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">texted </a>porn star Joslyn James. In fact, he texted, "I would wear you out" to her, too. The phrase spurred much <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">mocking</a> from the press.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">4. Olivia Munn</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Celebrity phone hacks are so common, most people don't really care anymore. However, when pics Olivia Munn privately sent to then-boyfriend Chris Pine were leaked, people couldn't stop talking about the text on the images, not the pictures themselves. Using some sort of photo editing software, Olivia allegedly added text on top of pictures of her in a bikini that said things like, "Please please please bite me bite me bite me." It was a little bizarre, and people couldn't help but chuckle at the odd vulgarity of it all. However, Olivia's reps denied the pics were of her. However, you can come to your <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">own conclusions.</a></p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">5. Farrah Abraham</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>In 2013, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TMZ</a> obtained screenshots of a text conversation between Teen Mom's Farrah Abraham and Charlie Sheen. In the messages, Farrah enthusiastically asked Charlie out on a date and even creepily suggested their kids could have a playdate, too. "Helloooooo!" she texted. "Just wanted to say I was excited to meet you. I just felt like saying your super funny and would love to meet you &nbsp;at some point & I'm in town a lot & hopefully soon will move to the area."</p><p>Charlie replied, "Coffee is for amateurs and grandma. Would love to get together!!"</p><p>But it didn't end there. Farrah texted him an essay a few days later that sounded completely off the handle. "Hey Charlie! I'm going to a b-day party," she wrote. "You can come if you are up for some drinks but there will be like pornstar ppl there, so if your not comfortable with that then &nbsp;let me know something else you would like to do. :)"</p><p>Charlie wrote back with, "That is quite the spectrum to navigate young lady..."</p><p>Not only did Farrah come across as desperate, what's even more baffling is that she leaked the entire conversation herself.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">6. David Boreanaz</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Rachel Uchitel, another one of Tiger Woods' mistresses, was also actor David Boreanaz's mistress. (I guess she's pretty popular.) Back in 2010, she leaked messages the Bones star sent her that sounded like they were written by a teenage boy. "OMG !!! I can't wait to F--K you!" he <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">allegedly texted</a>. "I want my puma soooooo bad, you are soooo f--ing HOT!!!" Needless to say, his wife later filed for divorce.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">7. Bow Wow</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>When rapper Bow Wow tried to woo video vixen Delianna Urena, she wasn't having it. So, in revenge, she leaked his "thirsty" emails — and they're pretty cringey. "I want you to be my girlfriend!" he allegedly <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote in an email</a> to her. "I'm serious!! I want to claim u sport u round and be the Man U want me to be. And we tear nyc up together. I lost my phone at the 4040 wifey so text me 678*******"</p><p>However, the leak provided more questions than answers. If Bow Wow lost his phone, why does he want her to text him??</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">8. Taylor Swift and Nick Jonas</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Back in 2015, a fan hacked Taylor Swift's Twitter account, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">exposing all her DMs</a>. However, unlike the other leaks in this list, hers was "scandalous" for how PG and tame it was. "Yeah tomorrow night I'm done at 4pm, dinner/drinks/gambling?" she texted Nick Jonas. "Are we bad kids now?" *clutches pearls*</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">9. Paris Hilton</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>When Paris Hilton's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sidekick was hacked way back in 2005</a>, it not only exposed dozens of celebs' phone numbers, it also revealed her baffling notepad full of nonsensical typos. From gems like, "tell ken about jess trying to bone JT" to "Do you wanna leave soon, ill pretend I have 2 go pee and u wait 3 mins than come by yourself to the back entrance," it was an important part of pop culture history that has largely been forgotten.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">10. Jesse James</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Remember him? He was Sandra Bullock's ex-husband who got caught having an affair. However it wasn't just the infidelity that turned this into a tabloid story, it was the racy texts. According to details leaked by the mistress, Jesse's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">messages ranged from</a>, "Speaking&nbsp;of licking"&nbsp;to "Wish is was cum'n! We are dorks." Well, he was right about the "dorks" part.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">11. G-Eazy</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>The rapper, who used to date Halsey, came under fire last year when texts he sent to another woman were leaked. In one conversation, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he told a woman</a>, "You got some a-- on you shorty" and "Lemme see the front tho." Unsurprisingly, he and Halsey broke up just a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">few months later.</a></p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">12. Shaq</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>When sports stars get caught sending racy texts to side pieces, it's a tale as old as time. In 2010, it was Shaq's turn in the hot seat when his mistress, Dominica Wrestling, leaked their affair to the press. "O my god were r u can i have u bak i miss u to whts yur number pls baby i want u bak do u love me," he <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">allegedly texted her</a>. They never learn.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaJ2eqbKzwMCipaadnql8c3yQcmZpaV9ngXC9ka%2BWcm6qiL5wr8SlnJurXZq6o63Rq5isq5mjtG7AxLGrrGWcmq6sscM%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
