Sowore has always lived outside the country. He doesn’t even know the policy implementation and policy initiative in the power sector.</p><p>“When we came in 1999, the total generation was about 4,000Megawatts. We initiated the building of nine additional power stations and by the time those nine were finished, the capacity has gone up from 4,000Megawatts to about 13,000Megawatts.</p><p>“Unfortunately, there was no correspondence increase as far as the transmission lines are concerned. There is no way when your transmission lines cannot evacuate the power that you are producing that it will not collapse. So they keep on collapsing.</p><p>“The additional power stations were completed by the Jonathan administration. Umar Yaradua was on it and he died, then Jonathan continued and he completed them. So, that is why anytime there is an increase in power generation, then you have a transmission system that cannot evacuate the power, there will be a collapse.</p><p>“So, Sowore doesn’t even know because he lives outside this country and comes in every four years and contest the presidency and fails and travels out again, What does he know about this? Nothing, absolutely nothing.”</p><p>In order to address the incessant electricity grid collapse in the nation, Atiku called for the decentralisation of the generation and transmission systems.</p><p>He also called for the use of various allied sources of power such as hydro, and solar among others to generate electricity.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH14e5FrZpqsmaDCbr%2FLmqSsZaOkxLC%2BxGamr52iYrCwucyepa1ln6N6r63ToqanmZxitLO1w2aaqKSclr20sY4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
