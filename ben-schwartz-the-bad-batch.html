She eagerly tells the crew that her riot racer is going to make her a lot of money.</p><p>Cid's riot racer turns out to be TAY-0, a droid (voiced by the one and only Ben Schwartz). Tech expresses skepticism that a droid is Cid's money-making riot racer, which insults TAY-0 immensely.</p><p>TAY-0 asks Tech, "Do you have a problem with droids human?" He also goads Tech with, "Do you want to challenge TAY-0?" Tech calmly notes he doesn't have enough data to make an informed decision, prompting TAY-0 to quip, "Then take a seat, spectacled spectator!"</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Lucasfilm</span><p>Tech was being rather rude to poor TAY-0, if you think about it.</p></figure><p>Star Wars fans immediately realized it was Ben voicing the sassy TAY-0. How could viewers not recognize his voice? After all, Ben was the voice of Sonic in Sonic the Hedgehog and Sonic the Hedgehog 2.</p><p>However, Ben isn't just a voice actor. He was a (uncredited) stormtrooper in <a href=#>Star Wars: The Force Awakens</a>. Interestingly enough, hat wasn't Ben's only role in the first of the Star Wars sequel films.</p><p>He was also the co-vocal consultant (alongside Bill Hader) for BB-8, Rey's (<a href=#>Daisy Ridley</a>) adorable droid companion. So this isn't Ben's first Star Wars droid-eo!</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>// the bad batch season 2 spoilers !! <a href=#>#thebadbatch</a><br>-<br>-<br>-<br>-<br>-<br>-<br>-<br>no because TAY 0 getting absolutely regina george style obliterated was one of the highlights of the episode i quite literally lol‚Äôdü§≠ <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/8zt7vuHtmz</a></p>‚Äî sammie‚Å∂‚Å∂ ‚åñ TBB ERA ·µïÃà (@imn0jedi) <a href=#>January 18, 2023</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr><a href=#>#TheBadBatch</a> spoilers!</p><p>-<br>-<br>-<br>-<br>-<br>-<br>-<br>-<br>OF COURSE BEN SCHWARTZ VOICED A BLUE COLORED CHARACTERüò≠üò≠ <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/aMEzRzGcCW</a></p>‚Äî sammie‚ù¶ (@sxmm08) <a href=#>January 18, 2023</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr><a href=#>#TheBadBatch</a> spoilers kind of<br>-<br>-<br>-<br>-<br>-<br>ben schwartz always gotta be playing some blue bitch huh <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/fKPvVPjWaU</a></p>‚Äî eren ‚òÜ‚ô™ (@hyejutano) <a href=#>January 18, 2023</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Will TAY-0 return in future episodes of 'Star Wars: The Bad Batch'?

Needless to say the accident means TAY-0 was in no shape to race, hence why Tech took over.</p><p>We kind of (well no, we really) hope Ben returns to voice more Bad Batch characters in future episodes, given his scene-stealing moments as TAY-0.</p><p>New episodes of Star Wars: The Bad Batch drop on Disney Plus every Wednesday.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfl7KvedKcn7CZoqnHbsDHnmSbmZRir6LAwqE%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. ¬© 2022.
