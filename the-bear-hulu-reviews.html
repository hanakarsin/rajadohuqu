From executive producers Joanna Calo, Hiro Murai, Nate Matteson, and Christopher Storer — the latter of whom is also the series' creator — FX on <a href=#>Hulu</a>'s <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Bear</a> is a heartfelt drama "about food, family, the insanity of the grind, the beauty of Sense of Urgency, and the steep slippery downsides," as detailed in the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">official synopsis</a>.</p><p>The story follows Carmen “Carmy” Berzatto (Jeremy Allen White), a chef who comes from the hoity-toity world of upscale dining. When he comes home to Chicago to operate a tiny sandwich shop called The Original Beef of Chicagoland — aka his family's restaurant — he's faced with more than the struggles of running a small business. See, Carmy and his family are still processing the tragic suicide of his brother, all while Carmy attempts to "change the chemistry" of the restaurant for the better.</p><p>"As Carmy fights to transform both The Original Beef of Chicagoland and himself, he works alongside a rough-around-the-edges kitchen crew that ultimately reveal themselves as his chosen family," the synopsis continues. Though The Bear was just released on June 23, 2022, it currently has a perfect Rotten Tomatoes score of 100 percent with 17 reviews.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Hulu</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Critics are over the moon for FX on Hulu's 'The Bear.' *Chef's kiss*</h2><p>The consensus seems to be that The Bear is *seasoned* with deep, heavy, relatable, and unfeigned moments. Should we stop with the culinary jokes now?</p><p>"From the performances to the directing, to the steady pacing of the episodes, there’s a thoughtfulness to The Bear that keeps it from sinking into the pit of self-pity that keeps tempting everyone who walks through the kitchen door," wrote Caroline Framke of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Variety</a>. Not only that, but she praised Jeremy Allen White's performance specifically.</p><p>"And with White practically vibrating at its center, imbuing Carmy with such pained restlessness that it’s often hard to look at him straight-on, what could easily tilt into cliché instead becomes a character study of people on the brink of triumph or ruin — whichever comes first."</p><p>This isn't super surprising, as Jeremy's decade-long performance as rebellious genius Phillip "Lip" Gallagher in Showtime's beloved dramedy series Shameless was stunningly nuanced and unsettlingly real at times.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-fyFmx rJYJh"></figure><p>Matthew Gilbert of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Boston Globe</a> also gave The Bear a positive review, but he pointed out its "tonal flaws," specifically related to "when the script pushes us too hard to view Carmy’s mission as heroic."</p><p>He also touched on how he wishes Carmy's sister, Sugar (Abby Elliott), got more screen time, though this didn't sour the show's overall taste for him.</p><p>"The first season fails to fully integrate Elliott into the story line, which is a shame; her scenes with White are charged, as they cope with the aftermath of suicide. But the show is so filled with good work that hardly matters in the long run.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Jeremy Allen White (@jeremyallenwhitefinally)</a></p></figure><p>All in all, critics can't say enough good things about The Bear.</p><p>As put beautifully by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Vulture</a>'s Jen Chaney, "These eight episodes may leave you breathless and a little dizzy.
